Foreword

PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON, by Executive Order No. 11130 dated
November 29, 1963,[F-1] created this Commission to investigate the
assassination on November 22, 1963, of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the
35th President of the United States. The President directed the
Commission to evaluate all the facts and circumstances surrounding the
assassination and the subsequent killing of the alleged assassin and to
report its findings and conclusions to him.[F-2]

The subject of the Commission’s inquiry was a chain of events which
saddened and shocked the people of the United States and of the world.
The assassination of President Kennedy and the simultaneous wounding
of John B. Connally, Jr., Governor of Texas, had been followed within
an hour by the slaying of Patrolman J. D. Tippit of the Dallas Police
Department. In the United States and abroad, these events evoked
universal demands for an explanation.

Immediately after the assassination, State and local officials in
Dallas devoted their resources to the apprehension of the assassin.
The U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for the protection
of the President, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation began an
investigation at the direction of President Johnson. Within 35 minutes
of the killing of Patrolman Tippit, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested
by the Dallas police as a suspect in that crime. Based on evidence
provided by Federal, State, and local agencies, the State of Texas
arraigned Oswald within 12 hours of his arrest, charging him with the
assassination of President Kennedy and the murder of Patrolman Tippit.
On November 24, 1963, less than 48 hours after his arrest, Oswald was
fatally shot in the basement of the Dallas Police Department by Jack
Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner. This shooting took place in full view
of a national television audience.

The events of these 2 days were witnessed with shock and disbelief
by a Nation grieving the loss of its young leader. Throughout the
world, reports on these events were disseminated in massive detail.
Theories and speculations mounted regarding the assassination. In many
instances, the intense public demand for facts was met by partial
and frequently conflicting reports from Dallas and elsewhere. After
Oswald’s arrest and his denial of all guilt, public attention focused
both on the extent of the evidence against him and the possibility of
a conspiracy, domestic or foreign. His subsequent death heightened
public interest and stimulated additional suspicions and rumors.


THE COMMISSION AND ITS POWERS

After Lee Harvey Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby, it was no longer
possible to arrive at the complete story of the assassination through
normal judicial procedures during a trial of the alleged assassin.
Alternative means for instituting a complete investigation were widely
discussed. Federal and State officials conferred on the possibility of
initiating a court of inquiry before a State magistrate in Texas. An
investigation by the grand jury of Dallas County also was considered.
As speculation about the existence of a foreign or domestic conspiracy
became widespread, committees in both Houses of Congress weighed the
desirability of congressional hearings to discover all the facts
relating to the assassination.

By his order of November 29 establishing the Commission, President
Johnson sought to avoid parallel investigations and to concentrate
factfinding in a body having the broadest national mandate. As Chairman
of the Commission, President Johnson selected Earl Warren, Chief
Justice of the United States, former Governor and attorney general of
the State of California. From the U.S. Senate, he chose Richard B.
Russell, Democratic Senator from Georgia and chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, former Governor of, and county attorney in,
the State of Georgia, and John Sherman Cooper, Republican Senator
from Kentucky, former county and circuit judge, State of Kentucky,
and U.S. Ambassador to India. Two members of the Commission were
drawn from the U.S. House of Representatives: Hale Boggs, Democratic
U.S. Representative from Louisiana and majority whip, and Gerald R.
Ford, Republican, U.S. Representative from Michigan and chairman of
the House Republican Conference. From private life, President Johnson
selected two lawyers by profession, both of whom have served in the
administrations of Democratic and Republican Presidents: Allen W.
Dulles, former Director of Central Intelligence, and John J. McCloy,
former President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, former U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, and during
World War II, the Assistant Secretary of War.

From its first meeting on December 5, 1963, the Commission viewed the
Executive order as an unequivocal Presidential mandate to conduct a
thorough and independent investigation. Because of the numerous rumors
and theories, the Commission concluded that the public interest in
insuring that the truth was ascertained could not be met by merely
accepting the reports or the analyses of Federal or State agencies.
Not only were the premises and conclusions of those reports critically
reassessed, but all assertions or rumors relating to a possible
conspiracy, or the complicity of others than Oswald, which have come to
the attention of the Commission, were investigated.

On December 13, 1963, Congress enacted Senate Joint Resolution 137
(Public Law 88-202)[F-3] empowering the Commission to issue subpoenas
requiring the testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence
relating to any matter under its investigation. In addition, the
resolution authorized the Commission to compel testimony from witnesses
claiming the privilege against self-incrimination under the fifth
amendment to the U.S. Constitution by providing for the grant of
immunity to persons testifying under such compulsion. Immunity under
these provisions was not granted to any witness during the Commission’s
investigation.

The Commission took steps immediately to obtain the necessary staff
to fulfill its assignment. J. Lee Rankin, former Solicitor General of
the United States, was sworn in as general counsel for the Commission
on December 16, 1963. Additional members of the legal staff were
selected during the next few weeks. The Commission has been aided by 14
assistant counsel with high professional qualifications, selected by it
from widely separated parts of the United States. This staff undertook
the work of the Commission with a wealth of legal and investigative
experience and a total dedication to the determination of the truth.
The Commission has been assisted also by highly qualified personnel
from several Federal agencies, assigned to the Commission at its
request. This group included lawyers from the Department of Justice,
agents of the Internal Revenue Service, a senior historian from the
Department of Defense, an editor from the Department of State, and
secretarial and administrative staff supplied by the General Services
Administration and other agencies.

In addition to the assistance afforded by Federal agencies,
the Commission throughout its inquiry had the cooperation of
representatives of the city of Dallas and the State of Texas. The
attorney general of Texas, Waggoner Carr, aided by two distinguished
lawyers of that State, Robert G. Storey of Dallas, retired dean of
the Southern Methodist University Law School and former president of
the American Bar Association, and Leon Jaworski of Houston, former
president of the Texas State Bar Association, has been fully informed
at all times as to the progress of the investigation, and has advanced
such suggestions as he and his special assistants considered helpful
to the accomplishment of the Commission’s assignment. Attorney General
Carr has promptly supplied the Commission with pertinent information
possessed by Texas officials. Dallas officials, particularly those from
the police department, have fully complied with all requests made by
the Commission.


THE INVESTIGATION

During December and early January the Commission received an increasing
volume of reports from Federal and State investigative agencies. Of
principal importance was the five-volume report of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, submitted on December 9, 1963, which summarized
the results of the investigation conducted by the Bureau immediately
after the assassination. After reviewing this report, the Commission
requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation to furnish the underlying
investigative materials relied upon in the summary report. The first
investigative reports submitted in response to this request were
delivered to the Commission on December 20, 1963. On December 18, the
Secret Service submitted a detailed report on security precautions
taken before President Kennedy’s trip to Texas and a summary of the
events of November 22, as witnessed by Secret Service agents. A few
days later the Department of State submitted a report relating to
Oswald’s defection to the Soviet Union in 1959, and his return to the
United States in 1962. On January 7 and 11, 1964, the attorney general
of Texas submitted an extensive set of investigative materials, largely
Dallas police reports, on the assassination of President Kennedy and
the killing of Oswald.

As these investigative reports were received, the staff began
analyzing and summarizing them. The members of the legal staff,
divided into teams, proceeded to organize the facts revealed by
these investigations, determine the issues, sort out the unresolved
problems, and recommend additional investigation by the Commission.
Simultaneously, to insure that no relevant information would be
overlooked, the Commission directed requests to the 10 major
departments of the Federal Government, 14 of its independent agencies
or commissions, and 4 congressional committees for all information
relating to the assassination or the background and activities of Lee
Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.

After reviewing the accumulating materials, the Commission directed
numerous additional requests to Federal and State investigative
agencies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service
executed the detailed requests for statements of witnesses and
examinations of physical evidence with dispatch and thoroughness. All
these reports were reviewed and analyzed by the Commission. Additional
investigative requests, where appropriate, were handled by Internal
Revenue Service, Department of State, and the military intelligence
agencies with comparable skill. Investigative analyses of particular
significance and sensitivity in the foreign areas were contributed
by the Central Intelligence Agency. On occasion the Commission used
independent experts from State and city governments to supplement or
verify information. During the investigation the Commission on several
occasions visited the scene of the assassination and other places in
the Dallas area pertinent to the inquiry.

The scope and detail of the investigative effort by the Federal and
State agencies are suggested in part by statistics from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service. Immediately after the
assassination more than 80 additional FBI personnel were transferred to
the Dallas office on a temporary basis to assist in the investigation.
Beginning November 22, 1963, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
conducted approximately 25,000 interviews and reinterviews of persons
having information of possible relevance to the investigation and by
September 11, 1964, submitted over 2,300 reports totaling approximately
25,400 pages to the Commission. During the same period the Secret
Service conducted approximately 1,550 interviews and submitted 800
reports totaling some 4,600 pages.

Because of the diligence, cooperation, and facilities of Federal
investigative agencies, it was unnecessary for the Commission to
employ investigators other than the members of the Commission’s legal
staff. The Commission recognized, however, that special measures were
required whenever the facts or rumors called for an appraisal of the
acts of the agencies themselves. The staff reviewed in detail the
actions of several Federal agencies, particularly the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, the Secret Service, the Central Intelligence Agency,
and the Department of State. Initially the Commission requested the
agencies to furnish all their reports relating to the assassination
and their relationships with Oswald or Ruby. On the basis of these
reports, the Commission submitted specific questions to the agency
involved. Members of the staff followed up the answers by reviewing
the relevant files of each agency for additional information. In some
instances, members of the Commission also reviewed the files in person.
Finally, the responsible officials of these agencies were called to
testify under oath. Dean Rusk, Secretary of State; C. Douglas Dillon,
Secretary of the Treasury; John A. McCone, Director of the Central
Intelligence Agency; J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation; and James J. Rowley, Chief of the Secret Service,
appeared as witnesses and testified fully regarding their agencies’
participation in the matters under scrutiny by the Commission.


COMMISSION HEARINGS

In addition to the information resulting from these investigations, the
Commission has relied primarily on the facts disclosed by the sworn
testimony of the principal witnesses to the assassination and related
events. Beginning on February 3, 1964, the Commission and its staff
has taken the testimony of 552 witnesses. Of this number, 94 appeared
before members of the Commission; 395 were questioned by members of
the Commission’s legal staff; 61 supplied sworn affidavits; and 2
gave statements.[F-4] Under Commission procedures, all witnesses were
advised that they had the right to the presence and the advice of their
lawyer during the interrogation, with the corollary rights to raise
objections to any questions asked, to make any clarifying statement on
the record after the interrogation, and to purchase a copy of their
testimony.[F-5]

Commission hearings were closed to the public unless the witness
appearing before the Commission requested an open hearing. Under these
procedures, testimony of one witness was taken in a public hearing
on two occasions. No other witness requested a public hearing. The
Commission concluded that the premature publication by it of testimony
regarding the assassination or the subsequent killing of Oswald might
interfere with Ruby’s rights to a fair and impartial trial on the
charges filed against him by the State of Texas. The Commission also
recognized that testimony would be presented before it which would
be inadmissible in judicial proceedings and might prejudice innocent
parties if made public out of context. In addition to the witnesses
who appeared before the Commission, numerous others provided sworn
depositions, affidavits, and statements upon which the Commission
has relied. Since this testimony, as well as that taken before the
Commission, could not always be taken in logical sequence, the
Commission concluded that partial publication of testimony as the
investigation progressed was impractical and could be misleading.


THE COMMISSION’S FUNCTION

The Commission’s most difficult assignments have been to uncover
all the facts concerning the assassination of President Kennedy and
to determine if it was in any way directed or encouraged by unknown
persons at home or abroad. In this process, its objective has been to
identify the person or persons responsible for both the assassination
of President Kennedy and the killing of Oswald through an examination
of the evidence. The task has demanded unceasing appraisal of the
evidence by the individual members of the Commission in their effort to
discover the whole truth.

The procedures followed by the Commission in developing and assessing
evidence necessarily differed from those of a court conducting a
criminal trial of a defendant present before it, since under our system
there is no provision for a posthumous trial. If Oswald had lived he
could have had a trial by American standards of justice where he would
have been able to exercise his full rights under the law. A judge and
jury would have presumed him innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt. He might have furnished information which could have
affected the course of his trial. He could have participated in and
guided his defense. There could have been an examination to determine
whether he was sane under prevailing legal standards. All witnesses,
including possibly the defendant, could have been subjected to
searching examination under the adversary system of American trials.

The Commission has functioned neither as a court presiding over an
adversary proceeding nor as a prosecutor determined to prove a case,
but as a factfinding agency committed to the ascertainment of the
truth. In the course of the investigation of the facts and rumors
surrounding these matters, it was necessary to explore hearsay and
other sources of information not admissible in a court proceeding
obtained from persons who saw or heard and others in a position to
observe what occurred. In fairness to the alleged assassin and his
family, the Commission on February 25, 1964, requested Walter E.
Craig, president of the American Bar Association, to participate in
the investigation and to advise the Commission whether in his opinion
the proceedings conformed to the basic principles of American justice.
Mr. Craig accepted this assignment and participated fully and without
limitation. He attended Commission hearings in person or through his
appointed assistants. All working papers, reports, and other data in
Commission files were made available, and Mr. Craig and his associates
were given the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, to recall any
witness heard prior to his appointment, and to suggest witnesses whose
testimony they would like to have the Commission hear. This procedure
was agreeable to counsel for Oswald’s widow.


THE COMMISSION’S REPORT

In this report the Commission submits the results of its investigation.
Each member of the Commission has given careful consideration to
the entire report and concurs in its findings and conclusions. The
report consists of an initial chapter summarizing the Commission’s
basic findings and conclusions, followed by a detailed analysis of
the facts and the issues raised by the events of November 22, 1963,
and the 2 following days. Individual chapters consider the trip to
Dallas, the shots from the Texas School Book Depository, the identity
of the assassin, the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald, the possibility
of a conspiracy, Oswald’s background and possible motive, and
arrangements for the protection of the President. In these chapters,
rather than rely on cross references, the Commission on occasion has
repeated certain testimony in order that the reader might have the
necessary information before him while examining the conclusions of the
Commission on each important issue.

With this report the Commission is submitting the complete testimony
of all the witnesses who appeared before the Commission or gave sworn
depositions or affidavits, the accompanying documentary exhibits, and
other investigative materials which are relied upon in this report. The
Commission is committing all of its reports and working papers to the
National Archives, where they can be permanently preserved under the
rules and regulations of the National Archives and applicable Federal
law.

CHAPTER I

Summary and Conclusions


The assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy on November 22, 1963,
was a cruel and shocking act of violence directed against a man, a
family, a nation, and against all mankind. A young and vigorous leader
whose years of public and private life stretched before him was the
victim of the fourth Presidential assassination in the history of a
country dedicated to the concepts of reasoned argument and peaceful
political change. This Commission was created on November 29, 1963,
in recognition of the right of people everywhere to full and truthful
knowledge concerning these events. This report endeavors to fulfill
that right and to appraise this tragedy by the light of reason and the
standard of fairness. It has been prepared with a deep awareness of
the Commission’s responsibility to present to the American people an
objective report of the facts relating to the assassination.


NARRATIVE OF EVENTS

At 11:40 a.m., c.s.t., on Friday, November 22, 1963, President John
F. Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy, and their party arrived at Love Field,
Dallas, Tex. Behind them was the first day of a Texas trip planned
5 months before by the President, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson,
and John B. Connally, Jr., Governor of Texas. After leaving the White
House on Thursday morning, the President had flown initially to San
Antonio where Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson joined the party and
the President dedicated new research facilities at the U.S. Air Force
School of Aerospace Medicine. Following a testimonial dinner in Houston
for U.S. Representative Albert Thomas, the President flew to Fort Worth
where he spent the night and spoke at a large breakfast gathering on
Friday.

Planned for later that day were a motorcade through downtown Dallas,
a luncheon speech at the Trade Mart, and a flight to Austin where
the President would attend a reception and speak at a Democratic
fundraising dinner. From Austin he would proceed to the Texas ranch of
the Vice President. Evident on this trip were the varied roles which
an American President performs--Head of State, Chief Executive, party
leader, and, in this instance, prospective candidate for reelection.

The Dallas motorcade, it was hoped, would evoke a demonstration of the
President’s personal popularity in a city which he had lost in the 1960
election. Once it had been decided that the trip to Texas would span 2
days, those responsible for planning, primarily Governor Connally and
Kenneth O’Donnell, a special assistant to the President, agreed that
a motorcade through Dallas would be desirable. The Secret Service was
told on November 8 that 45 minutes had been allotted to a motorcade
procession from Love Field to the site of a luncheon planned by Dallas
business and civic leaders in honor of the President. After considering
the facilities and security problems of several buildings, the Trade
Mart was chosen as the luncheon site. Given this selection, and in
accordance with the customary practice of affording the greatest number
of people an opportunity to see the President, the motorcade route
selected was a natural one. The route was approved by the local host
committee and White House representatives on November 18 and publicized
in the local papers starting on November 19. This advance publicity
made it clear that the motorcade would leave Main Street and pass the
intersection of Elm and Houston Streets as it proceeded to the Trade
Mart by way of the Stemmons Freeway.

By midmorning of November 22, clearing skies in Dallas dispelled the
threat of rain and the President greeted the crowds from his open
limousine without the “bubbletop,” which was at that time a plastic
shield furnishing protection only against inclement weather. To the
left of the President in the rear seat was Mrs. Kennedy. In the jump
seats were Governor Connally, who was in front of the President, and
Mrs. Connally at the Governor’s left. Agent William R. Greer of the
Secret Service was driving, and Agent Roy H. Kellerman was sitting to
his right.

Directly behind the Presidential limousine was an open “followup” car
with eight Secret Service agents, two in the front seat, two in the
rear, and two on each running board. These agents, in accordance with
normal Secret Service procedures, were instructed to scan the crowds,
the roofs, and windows of buildings, overpasses, and crossings for
signs of trouble. Behind the “followup” car was the Vice-Presidential
car carrying the Vice President and Mrs. Johnson and Senator Ralph W.
Yarborough. Next were a Vice-Presidential “followup” car and several
cars and buses for additional dignitaries, press representatives, and
others.

The motorcade left Love Field shortly after 11:50 a.m., and proceeded
through residential neighborhoods, stopping twice at the President’s
request to greet well-wishers among the friendly crowds. Each time
the President’s car halted, Secret Service agents from the “followup”
car moved forward to assume a protective stance near the President
and Mrs. Kennedy. As the motorcade reached Main Street, a principal
east-west artery in downtown Dallas, the welcome became tumultuous.
At the extreme west end of Main Street the motorcade turned right on
Houston Street and proceeded north for one block in order to make a
left turn on Elm Street, the most direct and convenient approach to the
Stemmons Freeway and the Trade Mart. As the President’s car approached
the intersection of Houston and Elm Streets, there loomed directly
ahead on the intersection’s northwest corner a seven-story, orange
brick warehouse and office building, the Texas School Book Depository.
Riding in the Vice President’s car, Agent Rufus W. Youngblood of the
Secret Service noticed that the clock atop the building indicated 12:30
p.m., the scheduled arrival time at the Trade Mart.

The President’s car which had been going north made a sharp turn
toward the southwest onto Elm Street. At a speed of about 11 miles per
hour, it started down the gradual descent toward a railroad overpass
under which the motorcade would proceed before reaching the Stemmons
Freeway. The front of the Texas School Book Depository was now on the
President’s right, and he waved to the crowd assembled there as he
passed the building. Dealey Plaza--an open, landscaped area marking the
western end of downtown Dallas--stretched out to the President’s left.
A Secret Service agent riding in the motorcade radioed the Trade Mart
that the President would arrive in 5 minutes.

Seconds later shots resounded in rapid succession. The President’s
hands moved to his neck. He appeared to stiffen momentarily and lurch
slightly forward in his seat. A bullet had entered the base of the back
of his neck slightly to the right of the spine. It traveled downward
and exited from the front of the neck, causing a nick in the left lower
portion of the knot in the President’s necktie. Before the shooting
started, Governor Connally had been facing toward the crowd on the
right. He started to turn toward the left and suddenly felt a blow on
his back. The Governor had been hit by a bullet which entered at the
extreme right side of his back at a point below his right armpit. The
bullet traveled through his chest in a downward and forward direction,
exited below his right nipple, passed through his right wrist which had
been in his lap, and then caused a wound to his left thigh. The force
of the bullet’s impact appeared to spin the Governor to his right, and
Mrs. Connally pulled him down into her lap. Another bullet then struck
President Kennedy in the rear portion of his head, causing a massive
and fatal wound. The President fell to the left into Mrs. Kennedy’s lap.

Secret Service Agent Clinton J. Hill, riding on the left running board
of the “followup” car, heard a noise which sounded like a firecracker
and saw the President suddenly lean forward and to the left. Hill
jumped off the car and raced toward the President’s limousine. In the
front seat of the Vice-Presidential car, Agent Youngblood heard an
explosion and noticed unusual movements in the crowd. He vaulted into
the rear seat and sat on the Vice President in order to protect him.
At the same time Agent Kellerman in the front seat of the Presidential
limousine turned to observe the President. Seeing that the President
was struck, Kellerman instructed the driver, “Let’s get out of here;
we are hit.” He radioed ahead to the lead car, “Get us to the hospital
immediately.” Agent Greer immediately accelerated the Presidential car.
As it gained speed, Agent Hill managed to pull himself onto the back of
the car where Mrs. Kennedy had climbed. Hill pushed her back into the
rear seat and shielded the stricken President and Mrs. Kennedy as the
President’s car proceeded at high speed to Parkland Memorial Hospital,
4 miles away.

At Parkland, the President was immediately treated by a team of
physicians who had been alerted for the President’s arrival by the
Dallas Police Department as the result of a radio message from the
motorcade after the shooting. The doctors noted irregular breathing
movements and a possible heartbeat, although they could not detect a
pulsebeat. They observed the extensive wound in the President’s head
and a small wound approximately one-fourth inch in diameter in the
lower third of his neck. In an effort to facilitate breathing, the
physicians performed a tracheotomy by enlarging the throat wound and
inserting a tube. Totally absorbed in the immediate task of trying to
preserve the President’s life, the attending doctors never turned the
President over for an examination of his back. At 1 p.m., after all
heart activity ceased and the Last Rites were administered by a priest,
President Kennedy was pronounced dead. Governor Connally underwent
surgery and ultimately recovered from his serious wounds.

Upon learning of the President’s death, Vice President Johnson left
Parkland Hospital under close guard and proceeded to the Presidential
plane at Love Field. Mrs. Kennedy, accompanying her husband’s body,
boarded the plane shortly thereafter. At 2:38 p.m., in the central
compartment of the plane, Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the 36th
President of the United States by Federal District Court Judge Sarah T.
Hughes. The plane left immediately for Washington, D.C., arriving at
Andrews AFB, Md., at 5:58 p.m., e.s.t. The President’s body was taken
to the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Md., where it was given
a complete pathological examination. The autopsy disclosed the large
head wound observed at Parkland and the wound in the front of the neck
which had been enlarged by the Parkland doctors when they performed the
tracheotomy. Both of these wounds were described in the autopsy report
as being “presumably of exit.” In addition the autopsy revealed a small
wound of entry in the rear of the President’s skull and another wound
of entry near the base of the back of the neck. The autopsy report
stated the cause of death as “Gunshot wound, head,” and the bullets
which struck the President were described as having been fired “from a
point behind and somewhat above the level of the deceased.”

At the scene of the shooting, there was evident confusion at the
outset concerning the point of origin of the shots. Witnesses differed
in their accounts of the direction from which the sound of the shots
emanated. Within a few minutes, however, attention centered on the
Texas School Book Depository Building as the source of the shots.
The building was occupied by a private corporation, the Texas School
Book Depository Co., which distributed school textbooks of several
publishers and leased space to representatives of the publishers. Most
of the employees in the building worked for these publishers. The
balance, including a 15-man warehousing crew, were employees of the
Texas School Book Depository Co. itself.

Several eyewitnesses in front of the building reported that they saw a
rifle being fired from the southeast corner window on the sixth floor
of the Texas School Book Depository. One eyewitness, Howard L. Brennan,
had been watching the parade from a point on Elm Street directly
opposite and facing the building. He promptly told a policeman that he
had seen a slender man, about 5 feet 10 inches, in his early thirties,
take deliberate aim from the sixth-floor corner window and fire a rifle
in the direction of the President’s car. Brennan thought he might be
able to identify the man since he had noticed him in the window a few
minutes before the motorcade made the turn onto Elm Street. At 12:34
p.m., the Dallas police radio mentioned the Depository Building as
a possible source of the shots, and at 12:45 p.m., the police radio
broadcast a description of the suspected assassin based primarily on
Brennan’s observations.

When the shots were fired, a Dallas motorcycle patrolman, Marrion L.
Baker, was riding in the motorcade at a point several cars behind the
President. He had turned right from Main Street onto Houston Street
and was about 200 feet south of Elm Street when he heard a shot.
Baker, having recently returned from a week of deer hunting, was
certain the shot came from a high-powered rifle. He looked up and saw
pigeons scattering in the air from their perches on the Texas School
Book Depository Building. He raced his motorcycle to the building,
dismounted, scanned the area to the west and pushed his way through the
spectators toward the entrance. There he encountered Roy Truly, the
building superintendent, who offered Baker his help. They entered the
building, and ran toward the two elevators in the rear. Finding that
both elevators were on an upper floor, they dashed up the stairs. Not
more than 2 minutes had elapsed since the shooting.

When they reached the second-floor landing on their way up to the top
of the building, Patrolman Baker thought he caught a glimpse of someone
through the small glass window in the door separating the hall area
near the stairs from the small vestibule leading into the lunchroom.
Gun in hand, he rushed to the door and saw a man about 20 feet away
walking toward the other end of the lunchroom. The man was emptyhanded.
At Baker’s command, the man turned and approached him. Truly, who had
started up the stairs to the third floor ahead of Baker, returned
to see what had delayed the patrolman. Baker asked Truly whether he
knew the man in the lunchroom. Truly replied that the man worked in
the building, whereupon Baker turned from the man and proceeded, with
Truly, up the stairs. The man they encountered had started working
in the Texas School Book Depository Building on October 16, 1963. His
fellow workers described him as very quiet--a “loner.” His name was Lee
Harvey Oswald.

Within about 1 minute after his encounter with Baker and Truly, Oswald
was seen passing through the second-floor offices. In his hand was a
full “Coke” bottle which he had purchased from a vending machine in
the lunchroom. He was walking toward the front of the building where
a passenger elevator and a short flight of stairs provided access to
the main entrance of the building on the first floor. Approximately 7
minutes later, at about 12:40 p.m., Oswald boarded a bus at a point on
Elm Street seven short blocks east of the Depository Building. The bus
was traveling west toward the very building from which Oswald had come.
Its route lay through the Oak Cliff section in southwest Dallas, where
it would pass seven blocks east of the roominghouse in which Oswald was
living, at 1026 North Beckley Avenue. On the bus was Mrs. Mary Bledsoe,
one of Oswald’s former landladies who immediately recognized him.
Oswald stayed on the bus approximately 3 or 4 minutes, during which
time it proceeded only two blocks because of the traffic jam created by
the motorcade and the assassination. Oswald then left the bus.

A few minutes later he entered a vacant taxi four blocks away and asked
the driver to take him to a point on North Beckley Avenue several
blocks beyond his roominghouse. The trip required 5 or 6 minutes. At
about 1 p.m. Oswald arrived at the roominghouse. The housekeeper, Mrs.
Earlene Roberts, was surprised to see Oswald at midday and remarked
to him that he seemed to be in quite a hurry. He made no reply. A few
minutes later Oswald emerged from his room zipping up his jacket and
rushed out of the house.

Approximately 14 minutes later, and just 45 minutes after the
assassination, another violent shooting occurred in Dallas. The victim
was Patrolman J. D. Tippit of the Dallas police, an officer with a
good record during his more than 11 years with the police force. He
was shot near the intersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, about
nine-tenths of a mile from Oswald’s roominghouse. At the time of the
assassination, Tippit was alone in his patrol car, the routine practice
for most police patrol cars at this time of day. He had been ordered by
radio at 12:45 p.m. to proceed to the central Oak Cliff area as part of
a concentration of patrol car activity around the center of the city
following the assassination. At 12:54 Tippit radioed that he had moved
as directed and would be available for any emergency. By this time the
police radio had broadcast several messages alerting the police to
the suspect described by Brennan at the scene of the assassination--a
slender white male, about 30 years old, 5 feet 10 inches and weighing
about 165 pounds.

At approximately 1:15 p.m., Tippit was driving slowly in an easterly
direction on East 10th Street in Oak Cliff. About 100 feet past the
intersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, Tippit pulled up
alongside a man walking in the same direction. The man met the general
description of the suspect wanted in connection with the assassination.
He walked over to Tippit’s car, rested his arms on the door on the
right-hand side of the car, and apparently exchanged words with Tippit
through the window. Tippit opened the door on the left side and started
to walk around the front of his car. As he reached the front wheel on
the driver’s side, the man on the sidewalk drew a revolver and fired
several shots in rapid succession, hitting Tippit four times and
killing him instantly. An automobile repairman, Domingo Benavides,
heard the shots and stopped his pickup truck on the opposite side of
the street about 25 feet in front of Tippit’s car. He observed the
gunman start back toward Patton Avenue, removing the empty cartridge
cases from the gun as he went. Benavides rushed to Tippit’s side. The
patrolman, apparently dead, was lying on his revolver, which was out
of its holster. Benavides promptly reported the shooting to police
headquarters over the radio in Tippit’s car. The message was received
shortly after 1:16 p.m.

As the gunman left the scene, he walked hurriedly back toward Patton
Avenue and turned left, heading south. Standing on the northwest corner
of 10th Street and Patton Avenue was Helen Markham, who had been
walking south on Patton Avenue and had seen both the killer and Tippit
cross the intersection in front of her as she waited on the curb for
traffic to pass. She witnessed the shooting and then saw the man with a
gun in his hand walk back toward the corner and cut across the lawn of
the corner house as he started south on Patton Avenue.

In the corner house itself, Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis and her
sister-in-law, Mrs. Virginia Davis, heard the shots and rushed to the
door in time to see the man walk rapidly across the lawn shaking a
revolver as if he were emptying it of cartridge cases. Later that day
each woman found a cartridge case near the house. As the gunman turned
the corner he passed alongside a taxicab which was parked on Patton
Avenue, a few feet from 10th Street. The driver, William W. Scoggins,
had seen the slaying and was now crouched behind his cab on the street
side. As the gunman cut through the shrubbery on the lawn, Scoggins
looked up and saw the man approximately 12 feet away. In his hand was a
pistol and he muttered words which sounded to Scoggins like “poor dumb
cop” or “poor damn cop.”

After passing Scoggins, the gunman crossed to the west side of Patton
Avenue and ran south toward Jefferson Boulevard, a main Oak Cliff
thoroughfare. On the east side of Patton, between 10th Street and
Jefferson Boulevard, Ted Callaway, a used car salesman, heard the shots
and ran to the sidewalk. As the man with the gun rushed past, Callaway
shouted “What’s going on?” The man merely shrugged, ran on to Jefferson
Boulevard and turned right. On the next corner was a gas station with a
parking lot in the rear. The assailant ran into the lot, discarded his
jacket and then continued his flight west on Jefferson.

In a shoe store a few blocks farther west on Jefferson, the manager,
Johnny Calvin Brewer, heard the siren of a police car moments after
the radio in his store announced the shooting of the police officer in
Oak Cliff. Brewer saw a man step quickly into the entranceway of the
store and stand there with his back toward the street. When the police
car made a =U=-turn and headed back in the direction of the Tippit
shooting, the man left and Brewer followed him. He saw the man enter
the Texas Theatre, a motion picture house about 60 feet away, without
buying a ticket. Brewer pointed this out to the cashier, Mrs. Julia
Postal, who called the police. The time was shortly after 1:40 p.m.

At 1:29 p.m., the police radio had noted the similarity in the
descriptions of the suspects in the Tippit shooting and the
assassination. At 1:45 p.m., in response to Mrs. Postal’s call, the
police radio sounded the alarm: “Have information a suspect just went
in the Texas Theatre on West Jefferson.” Within minutes the theater
was surrounded. The house lights were then turned up. Patrolman M. N.
McDonald and several other policemen approached the man, who had been
pointed out to them by Brewer.

McDonald ordered the man to his feet and heard him say, “Well, it’s all
over now.” The man drew a gun from his waist with one hand and struck
the officer with the other. McDonald struck out with his right hand and
grabbed the gun with his left hand. After a brief struggle McDonald and
several other police officers disarmed and handcuffed the suspect and
drove him to police headquarters, arriving at approximately 2 p.m.

Following the assassination, police cars had rushed to the Texas School
Book Depository in response to the many radio messages reporting that
the shots had been fired from the Depository Building. Inspector J.
Herbert Sawyer of the Dallas Police Department arrived at the scene
shortly after hearing the first of these police radio messages at 12:34
p.m. Some of the officers who had been assigned to the area of Elm
and Houston Streets for the motorcade were talking to witnesses and
watching the building when Sawyer arrived. Sawyer entered the building
and rode a passenger elevator to the fourth floor, which was the top
floor for this elevator. He conducted a quick search, returned to the
main floor and, between approximately 12:37 and 12:40 p.m., ordered
that no one be permitted to leave the building.

Shortly before 1 p.m. Capt. J. Will Fritz, chief of the homicide and
robbery bureau of the Dallas Police Department, arrived to take charge
of the investigation. Searching the sixth floor, Deputy Sheriff Luke
Mooney noticed a pile of cartons in the southeast corner. He squeezed
through the boxes and realized immediately that he had discovered the
point from which the shots had been fired. On the floor were three
empty cartridge cases. A carton had apparently been placed on the floor
at the side of the window so that a person sitting on the carton could
look down Elm Street toward the overpass and scarcely be noticed from
the outside. Between this carton and the half-open window were three
additional cartons arranged at such an angle that a rifle resting on
the top carton would be aimed directly at the motorcade as it moved
away from the building. The high stack of boxes, which first attracted
Mooney’s attention, effectively screened a person at the window from
the view of anyone else on the floor.

Mooney’s discovery intensified the search for additional evidence on
the sixth floor, and at 1:22 p.m., approximately 10 minutes after the
cartridge cases were found, Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone turned his
flashlight in the direction of two rows of boxes in the northwest
corner near the staircase. Stuffed between the two rows was a
bolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight. The rifle was not touched
until it could be photographed. When Lt. J. C. Day of the police
identification bureau decided that the wooden stock and the metal knob
at the end of the bolt contained no prints, he held the rifle by the
stock while Captain Fritz ejected a live shell by operating the bolt.
Lieutenant Day promptly noted that stamped on the rifle itself was the
serial number “C2766” as well as the markings “1940” “MADE ITALY” and
“CAL. 6.5.” The rifle was about 40 inches long and when disassembled it
could fit into a handmade paper sack which, after the assassination,
was found in the southeast corner of the building within a few feet of
the cartridge cases.

As Fritz and Day were completing their examination of this rifle on the
sixth floor, Roy Truly, the building superintendent, approached with
information which he felt should be brought to the attention of the
police. Earlier, while the police were questioning the employees, Truly
had observed that Lee Harvey Oswald, 1 of the 15 men who worked in the
warehouse, was missing. After Truly provided Oswald’s name, address,
and general description, Fritz left for police headquarters. He arrived
at headquarters shortly after 2 p.m. and asked two detectives to pick
up the employee who was missing from the Texas School Book Depository.
Standing nearby were the police officers who had just arrived with
the man arrested in the Texas Theatre. When Fritz mentioned the name
of the missing employee, he learned that the man was already in the
interrogation room. The missing School Book Depository employee and the
suspect who had been apprehended in the Texas Theatre were one and the
same--Lee Harvey Oswald.

The suspect Fritz was about to question in connection with the
assassination of the President and the murder of a policeman was born
in New Orleans on October 18, 1939, 2 months after the death of his
father. His mother, Marguerite Claverie Oswald, had two older children.
One, John Pic, was a half-brother to Lee from an earlier marriage which
had ended in divorce. The other was Robert Oswald, a full brother to
Lee and 5 years older. When Lee Oswald was 3, Mrs. Oswald placed him in
an orphanage where his brother and half-brother were already living,
primarily because she had to work.

In January 1944, when Lee was 4, he was taken out of the orphanage, and
shortly thereafter his mother moved with him to Dallas, Tex., where
the older boys joined them at the end of the school year. In May of
1945 Marguerite Oswald married her third husband, Edwin A. Ekdahl.
While the two older boys attended a military boarding school, Lee
lived at home and developed a warm attachment to Ekdahl, occasionally
accompanying his mother and stepfather on business trips around the
country. Lee started school in Benbrook, Tex., but in the fall of
1946, after a separation from Ekdahl, Marguerite Oswald reentered Lee
in the first grade in Covington, La. In January 1947, while Lee was
still in the first grade, the family moved to Fort Worth, Tex., as the
result of an attempted reconciliation between Ekdahl and Lee’s mother.
A year and a half later, before Lee was 9, his mother was divorced
from her third husband as the result of a divorce action instituted by
Ekdahl. Lee’s school record during the next 5½ years in Fort Worth was
average, although generally it grew poorer each year. The comments of
teachers and others who knew him at that time do not reveal any unusual
personality traits or characteristics.

Another change for Lee Oswald occurred in August 1952, a few months
after he completed the sixth grade. Marguerite Oswald and her
12-year-old son moved to New York City where Marguerite’s oldest
son, John Pic, was stationed with the Coast Guard. The ensuing year
and one-half in New York was marked by Lee’s refusals to attend
school and by emotional and psychological problems of a seemingly
serious nature. Because he had become a chronic school truant, Lee
underwent psychiatric study at Youth House, an institution in New
York for juveniles who have had truancy problems or difficulties
with the law, and who appear to require psychiatric observation,
or other types of guidance. The social worker assigned to his case
described him as “seriously detached” and “withdrawn” and noted “a
rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved,
affectionless youngster.” Lee expressed the feeling to the social
worker that his mother did not care for him and regarded him as a
burden. He experienced fantasies about being all powerful and hurting
people, but during his stay at Youth House he was apparently not
a behavior problem. He appeared withdrawn and evasive, a boy who
preferred to spend his time alone, reading and watching television.
His tests indicated that he was above average in intelligence for
his age group. The chief psychiatrist of Youth House diagnosed Lee’s
problem as a “personality pattern disturbance with schizoid features
and passive-aggressive tendencies.” He concluded that the boy was “an
emotionally, quite disturbed youngster” and recommended psychiatric
treatment.

In May 1953, after having been at Youth House for 3 weeks, Lee Oswald
returned to school where his attendance and grades temporarily
improved. By the following fall, however, the probation officer
reported that virtually every teacher complained about the boy’s
behavior. His mother insisted that he did not need psychiatric
assistance. Although there was apparently some improvement in Lee’s
behavior during the next few months, the court recommended further
treatment. In January 1954, while Lee’s case was still pending,
Marguerite and Lee left for New Orleans, the city of Lee’s birth.

Upon his return to New Orleans, Lee maintained mediocre grades but
had no obvious behavior problems. Neighbors and others who knew him
outside of school remembered him as a quiet, solitary and introverted
boy who read a great deal and whose vocabulary made him quite
articulate. About 1 month after he started the 10th grade and 11 days
before his 16th birthday in October 1955, he brought to school a note
purportedly written by his mother, stating that the family was moving
to California. The note was written by Lee. A few days later he dropped
out of school and almost immediately tried to join the Marine Corps.
Because he was only 16, he was rejected.

After leaving school Lee worked for the next 10 months at several jobs
in New Orleans as an office messenger or clerk. It was during this
period that he started to read communist literature. Occasionally,
in conversations with others, he praised communism and expressed to
his fellow employees a desire to join the Communist Party. At about
this time, when he was not yet 17, he wrote to the Socialist Party of
America, professing his belief in Marxism.

Another move followed in July 1956 when Lee and his mother returned
to Fort Worth. He reentered high school but again dropped out after
a few weeks and enlisted in the Marine Corps on October 24, 1956, 6
days after his 17th birthday. On December 21, 1956, during boot camp
in San Diego, Oswald fired a score of 212 for record with the M-1
rifle--2 points over the minimum for a rating of “sharpshooter” on a
marksman/sharpshooter/expert scale. After his basic training, Oswald
received training in aviation fundamentals and then in radar scanning.

Most people who knew Oswald in the Marines described him as a “loner”
who resented the exercise of authority by others. He spent much of
his free time reading. He was court-martialed once for possessing an
unregistered privately owned weapon and, on another occasion, for using
provocative language to a noncommissioned officer. He was, however,
generally able to comply with Marine discipline, even though his
experiences in the Marine Corps did not live up to his expectations.

Oswald served 15 months overseas until November 1958, most of it in
Japan. During his final year in the Marine Corps he was stationed for
the most part in Santa Ana, Calif., where he showed a marked interest
in the Soviet Union and sometimes expressed politically radical views
with dogmatic conviction. Oswald again fired the M-1 rifle for record
on May 6, 1959, and this time he shot a score of 191 on a shorter
course than before, only 1 point over the minimum required to be a
“marksman.” According to one of his fellow marines, Oswald was not
particularly interested in his rifle performance, and his unit was not
expected to exhibit the usual rifle proficiency. During this period
he expressed strong admiration for Fidel Castro and an interest in
joining the Cuban army. He tried to impress those around him as an
intellectual, but his thinking appeared to some as shallow and rigid.

Oswald’s Marine service terminated on September 11, 1959, when at his
own request he was released from active service a few months ahead
of his scheduled release. He offered as the reason for his release
the ill health and economic plight of his mother. He returned to Fort
Worth, remained with his mother only 3 days and left for New Orleans,
telling his mother he planned to get work there in the shipping or
import-export business. In New Orleans he booked passage on the
freighter SS _Marion Lykes_, which sailed from New Orleans to Le Havre,
France, on September 20, 1959.

Lee Harvey Oswald had presumably planned this step in his life for
quite some time. In March of 1959 he had applied to the Albert
Schweitzer College in Switzerland for admission to the spring 1960
term. His letter of application contained many blatant falsehoods
concerning his qualifications and background. A few weeks before his
discharge he had applied for and obtained a passport, listing the
Soviet Union as one of the countries which he planned to visit. During
his service in the Marines he had saved a comparatively large sum of
money, possibly as much as $1,500, which would appear to have been
accomplished by considerable frugality and apparently for a specific
purpose.

The purpose of the accumulated fund soon became known. On October 16,
1959, Oswald arrived in Moscow by train after crossing the border
from Finland, where he had secured a visa for a 6-day stay in the
Soviet Union. He immediately applied for Soviet citizenship. On the
afternoon of October 21, 1959, Oswald was ordered to leave the Soviet
Union by 8 p.m. that evening. That same afternoon in his hotel room
Oswald, in an apparent suicide attempt, slashed his left wrist. He
was hospitalized immediately. On October 31, 3 days after his release
from the hospital, Oswald appeared at the American Embassy, announced
that he wished to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a Russian
citizen, and handed the Embassy officer a written statement he had
prepared for the occasion. When asked his reasons, Oswald replied, “I
am a Marxist.” Oswald never formally complied with the legal steps
necessary to renounce his American citizenship. The Soviet Government
did not grant his request for citizenship, but in January 1960 he was
given permission to remain in the Soviet Union on a year-to-year basis.
At the same time Oswald was sent to Minsk where he worked in a radio
factory as an unskilled laborer. In January 1961 his permission to
remain in the Soviet Union was extended for another year. A few weeks
later, in February 1961, he wrote to the American Embassy in Moscow
expressing a desire to return to the United States.

The following month Oswald met a 19-year-old Russian girl, Marina
Nikolaevna Prusakova, a pharmacist, who had been brought up in
Leningrad but was then living with an aunt and uncle in Minsk. They
were married on April 30, 1961. Throughout the following year he
carried on a correspondence with American and Soviet authorities
seeking approval for the departure of himself and his wife to the
United States. In the course of this effort, Oswald and his wife
visited the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in July of 1961. Primarily on the
basis of an interview and questionnaire completed there, the Embassy
concluded that Oswald had not lost his citizenship, a decision
subsequently ratified by the Department of State in Washington, D.C.
Upon their return to Minsk, Oswald and his wife filed with the Soviet
authorities for permission to leave together. Their formal application
was made in July 1961, and on December 25, 1961, Marina Oswald was
advised it would be granted.

A daughter was born to the Oswalds in February 1962. In the months that
followed they prepared for their return to the United States. On May 9,
1962, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, at the request
of the Department of State, agreed to waive a restriction under the
law which would have prevented the issuance of a United States visa to
Oswald’s Russian wife until she had left the Soviet Union. They finally
left Moscow on June 1, 1962, and were assisted in meeting their travel
expenses by a loan of $435.71 from the U.S. Department of State. Two
weeks later they arrived in Fort Worth, Tex.

For a few weeks Oswald, his wife and child lived with Oswald’s brother
Robert. After a similar stay with Oswald’s mother, they moved into
their own apartment in early August. Oswald obtained a job on July
16 as a sheet metal worker. During this period in Fort Worth, Oswald
was interviewed twice by agents of the FBI. The report of the first
interview, which occurred on June 26, described him as arrogant and
unwilling to discuss the reasons why he had gone to the Soviet Union.
Oswald denied that he was involved in Soviet intelligence activities
and promised to advise the FBI if Soviet representatives ever
communicated with him. He was interviewed again on August 16, when he
displayed a less belligerent attitude and once again agreed to inform
the FBI of any attempt to enlist him in intelligence activities.

In early October 1962 Oswald quit his job at the sheet metal plant
and moved to Dallas. While living in Forth Worth the Oswalds had been
introduced to a group of Russian-speaking people in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area. Many of them assisted the Oswalds by providing small
amounts of food, clothing, and household items. Oswald himself was
disliked by almost all of this group whose help to the family was
prompted primarily by sympathy for Marina Oswald and the child.
Despite the fact that he had left the Soviet Union, disillusioned
with its Government, Oswald seemed more firmly committed than ever to
his concepts of Marxism. He showed disdain for democracy, capitalism,
and American society in general. He was highly critical of the
Russian-speaking group because they seemed devoted to American concepts
of democracy and capitalism and were ambitious to improve themselves
economically.

In February 1963 the Oswalds met Ruth Paine at a social gathering. Ruth
Paine was temporarily separated from her husband and living with her
two children in their home in Irving, Tex., a suburb of Dallas. Because
of an interest in the Russian language and sympathy for Marina Oswald,
who spoke no English and had little funds, Ruth Paine befriended Marina
and, during the next 2 months, visited her on several occasions.

On April 6, 1963, Oswald lost his job with a photography firm. A few
days later, on April 10, he attempted to kill Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker
(Resigned, U.S. Army), using a rifle which he had ordered by mail 1
month previously under an assumed name. Marina Oswald learned of her
husband’s act when she confronted him with a note which he had left,
giving her instructions in the event he did not return. That incident
and their general economic difficulties impelled Marina Oswald to
suggest that her husband leave Dallas and go to New Orleans to look for
work.

Oswald left for New Orleans on April 24, 1963. Ruth Paine, who knew
nothing of the Walker shooting, invited Marina Oswald and the baby to
stay with her in the Paines’ modest home while Oswald sought work in
New Orleans. Early in May, upon receiving word from Oswald that he had
found a job, Ruth Paine drove Marina Oswald and the baby to New Orleans
to rejoin Oswald.

During the stay in New Orleans, Oswald formed a fictitious New Orleans
Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He posed as secretary of
this organization and represented that the president was A. J. Hidell.
In reality, Hidell was a completely fictitious person created by
Oswald, the organization’s only member. Oswald was arrested on August 9
in connection with a scuffle which occurred while he was distributing
pro-Castro leaflets. The next day, while at the police station, he
was interviewed by an FBI agent after Oswald requested the police to
arrange such an interview. Oswald gave the agent false information
about his own background and was evasive in his replies concerning Fair
Play for Cuba activities. During the next 2 weeks Oswald appeared on
radio programs twice, claiming to be the spokesman for the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee in New Orleans.

On July 19, 1963, Oswald lost his job as a greaser of coffee processing
machinery. In September, after an exchange of correspondence with
Marina Oswald, Ruth Paine drove to New Orleans and on September 23,
transported Marina, the child, and the family belongings to Irving,
Tex. Ruth Paine suggested that Marina Oswald, who was expecting her
second child in October, live at the Paine house until after the baby
was born. Oswald remained behind, ostensibly to find work either in
Houston or some other city. Instead, he departed by bus for Mexico,
arriving in Mexico City on September 27, where he promptly visited
the Cuban and Russian Embassies. His stated objective was to obtain
official permission to visit Cuba, on his way to the Soviet Union. The
Cuban Government would not grant his visa unless the Soviet Government
would also issue a visa permitting his entry into Russia. Oswald’s
efforts to secure these visas failed, and he left for Dallas, where he
arrived on October 3, 1963.

When he saw his wife the next day, it was decided that Oswald would
rent a room in Dallas and visit his family on weekends. For 1 week he
rented a room from Mrs. Bledsoe, the woman who later saw him on the bus
shortly after the assassination. On October 14, 1963, he rented the
Beckley Avenue room and listed his name as O. H. Lee. On the same day,
at the suggestion of a neighbor, Mrs. Paine phoned the Texas School
Book Depository and was told that there was a job opening. She informed
Oswald who was interviewed the following day at the Depository and
started to work there on October 16, 1963.

On October 20 the Oswalds’ second daughter was born. During October
and November Oswald established a general pattern of weekend visits to
Irving, arriving on Friday afternoon and returning to Dallas Monday
morning with a fellow employee, Buell Wesley Frazier, who lived near
the Paines. On Friday, November 15, Oswald remained in Dallas at the
suggestion of his wife who told him that the house would be crowded
because of a birthday party for Ruth Paine’s daughter. On Monday,
November 18, Oswald and his wife quarreled bitterly during a telephone
conversation, because she learned for the first time that he was living
at the roominghouse under an assumed name. On Thursday, November 21,
Oswald told Frazier that he would like to drive to Irving to pick up
some curtain rods for an apartment in Dallas. His wife and Mrs. Paine
were quite surprised to see him since it was a Thursday night. They
thought he had returned to make up after Monday’s quarrel. He was
conciliatory, but Marina Oswald was still angry.

Later that evening, when Mrs. Paine had finished cleaning the kitchen,
she went into the garage and noticed that the light was burning. She
was certain that she had not left it on, although the incident appeared
unimportant at the time. In the garage were most of the Oswalds’
personal possessions. The following morning Oswald left while his wife
was still in bed feeding the baby. She did not see him leave the house,
nor did Ruth Paine. On the dresser in their room he left his wedding
ring which he had never done before. His wallet containing $170 was
left intact in a dresser-drawer.

Oswald walked to Frazier’s house about half a block away and placed a
long bulky package, made out of wrapping paper and tape, into the rear
seat of the car. He told Frazier that the package contained curtain
rods. When they reached the Depository parking lot, Oswald walked
quickly ahead. Frazier followed and saw Oswald enter the Depository
Building carrying the long bulky package with him.

During the morning of November 22, Marina Oswald followed President
Kennedy’s activities on television. She and Ruth Paine cried when they
heard that the President had been shot. Ruth Paine translated the news
of the shooting to Marina Oswald as it came over television, including
the report that the shots were probably fired from the building where
Oswald worked. When Marina Oswald heard this, she recalled the Walker
episode and the fact that her husband still owned the rifle. She went
quietly to the Paine’s garage where the rifle had been concealed in a
blanket among their other belongings. It appeared to her that the rifle
was still there, although she did not actually open the blanket.

At about 3 p.m. the police arrived at the Paine house and asked Marina
Oswald whether her husband owned a rifle. She said that he did and then
led them into the garage and pointed to the rolled up blanket. As a
police officer lifted it, the blanket hung limply over either side of
his arm. The rifle was not there.

Meanwhile, at police headquarters, Captain Fritz had begun questioning
Oswald. Soon after the start of the first interrogation, agents of
the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service arrived and participated in the
questioning. Oswald denied having anything to do with the assassination
of President Kennedy or the murder of Patrolman Tippit. He claimed that
he was eating lunch at the time of the assassination, and that he then
spoke with his foreman for 5 to 10 minutes before going home. He denied
that he owned a rifle and when confronted, in a subsequent interview,
with a picture showing him holding a rifle and pistol, he claimed that
his face had been superimposed on someone else’s body. He refused to
answer any questions about the presence in his wallet of a selective
service card with his picture and the name “Alek J. Hidell.”

During the questioning of Oswald on the third floor of the police
department, more than 100 representatives of the press, radio, and
television were crowded into the hallway through which Oswald had
to pass when being taken from his cell to Captain Fritz’ office for
interrogation. Reporters tried to interview Oswald during these
trips. Between Friday afternoon and Sunday morning he appeared in the
hallway at least 16 times. The generally confused conditions outside
and inside Captain Fritz’ office increased the difficulty of police
questioning. Advised by the police that he could communicate with an
attorney, Oswald made several telephone calls on Saturday in an effort
to procure representation of his own choice and discussed the matter
with the president of the local bar association, who offered to obtain
counsel. Oswald declined the offer saying that he would first try to
obtain counsel by himself. By Sunday morning he had not yet engaged an
attorney.

At 7:10 p.m. on November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald was formally
advised that he had been charged with the murder of Patrolman J.D.
Tippit. Several witnesses to the Tippit slaying and to the subsequent
flight of the gunman had positively identified Oswald in police
lineups. While positive firearm identification evidence was not
available at the time, the revolver in Oswald’s possession at the time
of his arrest was of a type which could have fired the shots that
killed Tippit.

The formal charge against Oswald for the assassination of President
Kennedy was lodged shortly after 1:30 a.m., on Saturday, November 23.
By 10 p.m. of the day of the assassination, the FBI had traced the
rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository to
a mailorder house in Chicago which had purchased it from a distributor
in New York. Approximately 6 hours later the Chicago firm advised
that this rifle had been ordered in March 1963 by an A. Hidel for
shipment to post office box 2915, in Dallas, Tex., a box rented by
Oswald. Payment for the rifle was remitted by a money order signed by
A. Hidell. By 6:45 p.m. on November 23, the FBI was able to advise
the Dallas police that, as a result of handwriting analysis of the
documents used to purchase the rifle, it had concluded that the rifle
had been ordered by Lee Harvey Oswald.

Throughout Friday and Saturday, the Dallas police released to the
public many of the details concerning the alleged evidence against
Oswald. Police officials discussed important aspects of the case,
usually in the course of impromptu and confused press conferences
in the third-floor corridor. Some of the information divulged was
erroneous. Efforts by the news media representatives to reconstruct the
crime and promptly report details frequently led to erroneous and often
conflicting reports. At the urgings of the newsmen, Chief of Police
Jesse E. Curry, brought Oswald to a press conference in the police
assembly room shortly after midnight of the day Oswald was arrested.
The assembly room was crowded with newsmen who had come to Dallas from
all over the country. They shouted questions at Oswald and flashed
cameras at him. Among this group was a 52-year-old Dallas nightclub
operator--Jack Ruby.

On Sunday morning, November 24, arrangements were made for Oswald’s
transfer from the city jail to the Dallas County jail, about 1 mile
away. The news media had been informed on Saturday night that the
transfer of Oswald would not take place until after 10 a.m. on Sunday.
Earlier on Sunday, between 2:30 and 3 a.m., anonymous telephone calls
threatening Oswald’s life had been received by the Dallas office of the
FBI and by the office of the county sheriff. Nevertheless, on Sunday
morning, television, radio, and newspaper representatives crowded into
the basement to record the transfer. As viewed through television
cameras, Oswald would emerge from a door in front of the cameras and
proceed to the transfer vehicle. To the right of the cameras was a
“down” ramp from Main Street on the north. To the left was an “up” ramp
leading to Commerce Street on the south.

The armored truck in which Oswald was to be transferred arrived shortly
after 11 a.m. Police officials then decided, however, that an unmarked
police car would be preferable for the trip because of its greater
speed and maneuverability. At approximately 11:20 a.m. Oswald emerged
from the basement jail office flanked by detectives on either side and
at his rear. He took a few steps toward the car and was in the glaring
light of the television cameras when a man suddenly darted out from
an area on the right of the cameras where newsmen had been assembled.
The man was carrying a Colt .38 revolver in his right hand and, while
millions watched on television, he moved quickly to within a few feet
of Oswald and fired one shot into Oswald’s abdomen. Oswald groaned with
pain as he fell to the ground and quickly lost consciousness. Within 7
minutes Oswald was at Parkland Hospital where, without having regained
consciousness, he was pronounced dead at 1:07 p.m.

The man who killed Oswald was Jack Ruby. He was instantly arrested and,
minutes later, confined in a cell on the fifth floor of the Dallas
police jail. Under interrogation, he denied that the killing of Oswald
was in any way connected with a conspiracy involving the assassination
of President Kennedy. He maintained that he had killed Oswald in a
temporary fit of depression and rage over the President’s death. Ruby
was transferred the following day to the county jail without notice to
the press or to police officers not directly involved in the transfer.
Indicted for the murder of Oswald by the State of Texas on November 26,
1963, Ruby was found guilty on March 14, 1964, and sentenced to death.
As of September 1964, his case was pending on appeal.


CONCLUSIONS

This Commission was created to ascertain the facts relating to the
preceding summary of events and to consider the important questions
which they raised. The Commission has addressed itself to this task and
has reached certain conclusions based on all the available evidence.
No limitations have been placed on the Commission’s inquiry; it has
conducted its own investigation, and all Government agencies have fully
discharged their responsibility to cooperate with the Commission in its
investigation. These conclusions represent the reasoned judgment of
all members of the Commission and are presented after an investigation
which has satisfied the Commission that it has ascertained the truth
concerning the assassination of President Kennedy to the extent that a
prolonged and thorough search makes this possible.

1. The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor
Connally were fired from the sixth floor window at the southeast corner
of the Texas School Book Depository. This determination is based upon
the following:

    (_a_) Witnesses at the scene of the assassination saw a rifle
    being fired from the sixth floor window of the Depository
    Building, and some witnesses saw a rifle in the window
    immediately after the shots were fired.

    (_b_) The nearly whole bullet found on Governor Connally’s
    stretcher at Parkland Memorial Hospital and the two bullet
    fragments found in the front seat of the Presidential limousine
    were fired from the 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano rifle
    found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building to the
    exclusion of all other weapons.

    (_c_) The three used cartridge cases found near the window on
    the sixth floor at the southeast corner of the building were
    fired from the same rifle which fired the above-described
    bullet and fragments, to the exclusion of all other weapons.

    (_d_) The windshield in the Presidential limousine was struck
    by a bullet fragment on the inside surface of the glass, but
    was not penetrated.

    (_e_) The nature of the bullet wounds suffered by President
    Kennedy and Governor Connally and the location of the car at
    the time of the shots establish that the bullets were fired
    from above and behind the Presidential limousine, striking the
    President and the Governor as follows:

    (1) President Kennedy was first struck by a bullet which
    entered at the back of his neck and exited through the lower
    front portion of his neck, causing a wound which would not
    necessarily have been lethal. The President was struck a second
    time by a bullet which entered the right-rear portion of his
    head, causing a massive and fatal wound.

    (2) Governor Connally was struck by a bullet which entered on
    the right side of his back and traveled downward through the
    right side of his chest, exiting below his right nipple. This
    bullet then passed through his right wrist and entered his left
    thigh where it caused a superficial wound.

    (_f_) There is no credible evidence that the shots were fired
    from the Triple Underpass, ahead of the motorcade, or from any
    other location.

2. The weight of the evidence indicates that there were three shots
fired.

3. Although it is not necessary to any essential findings of the
Commission to determine just which shot hit Governor Connally, there
is very persuasive evidence from the experts to indicate that the
same bullet which pierced the President’s throat also caused Governor
Connally’s wounds. However, Governor Connally’s testimony and certain
other factors have given rise to some difference of opinion as to this
probability but there is no question in the mind of any member of the
Commission that all the shots which caused the President’s and Governor
Connally’s wounds were fired from the sixth floor window of the Texas
School Book Depository.

4. The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor
Connally were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald. This conclusion is based upon
the following:

    (_a_) The Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle from
    which the shots were fired was owned by and in the possession
    of Oswald.

    (_b_) Oswald carried this rifle into the Depository Building on
    the morning of November 22, 1963.

    (_c_) Oswald, at the time of the assassination, was present at
    the window from which the shots were fired.

    (_d_) Shortly after the assassination, the Mannlicher-Carcano
    rifle belonging to Oswald was found partially hidden between
    some cartons on the sixth floor and the improvised paper bag
    in which Oswald brought the rifle to the Depository was found
    close by the window from which the shots were fired.

    (_e_) Based on testimony of the experts and their analysis of
    films of the assassination, the Commission has concluded that a
    rifleman of Lee Harvey Oswald’s capabilities could have fired
    the shots from the rifle used in the assassination within the
    elapsed time of the shooting. The Commission has concluded
    further that Oswald possessed the capability with a rifle
    which enabled him to commit the assassination.

    (_f_) Oswald lied to the police after his arrest concerning
    important substantive matters.

    (_g_) Oswald had attempted to kill Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker
    (Resigned, U. S. Army) on April 10, 1963, thereby demonstrating
    his disposition to take human life.

5. Oswald killed Dallas Police Patrolman J. D. Tippit approximately 45
minutes after the assassination. This conclusion upholds the finding
that Oswald fired the shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded
Governor Connally and is supported by the following:

    (_a_) Two eyewitnesses saw the Tippit shooting and seven
    eyewitnesses heard the shots and saw the gunman leave the scene
    with revolver in hand. These nine eyewitnesses positively
    identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw.

    (_b_) The cartridge cases found at the scene of the shooting
    were fired from the revolver in the possession of Oswald at the
    time of his arrest to the exclusion of all other weapons.

    (_c_) The revolver in Oswald’s possession at the time of his
    arrest was purchased by and belonged to Oswald.

    (_d_) Oswald’s jacket was found along the path of flight taken
    by the gunman as he fled from the scene of the killing.

6. Within 80 minutes of the assassination and 35 minutes of the Tippit
killing Oswald resisted arrest at the theatre by attempting to shoot
another Dallas police officer.

7. The Commission has reached the following conclusions concerning
Oswald’s interrogation and detention by the Dallas police:

    (_a_) Except for the force required to effect his arrest,
    Oswald was not subjected to any physical coercion by any law
    enforcement officials. He was advised that he could not be
    compelled to give any information and that any statements made
    by him might be used against him in court. He was advised of
    his right to counsel. He was given the opportunity to obtain
    counsel of his own choice and was offered legal assistance by
    the Dallas Bar Association, which he rejected at that time.

    (_b_) Newspaper, radio, and television reporters were allowed
    uninhibited access to the area through which Oswald had to
    pass when he was moved from his cell to the interrogation room
    and other sections of the building, thereby subjecting Oswald
    to harassment and creating chaotic conditions which were not
    conducive to orderly interrogation or the protection of the
    rights of the prisoner.

    (_c_) The numerous statements, sometimes erroneous, made to
    the press by various local law enforcement officials, during
    this period of confusion and disorder in the police station,
    would have presented serious obstacles to the obtaining of
    a fair trial for Oswald. To the extent that the information
    was erroneous or misleading, it helped to create doubts,
    speculations, and fears in the mind of the public which might
    otherwise not have arisen.

8. The Commission has reached the following conclusions concerning the
killing of Oswald by Jack Ruby on November 24, 1963:

    (_a_) Ruby entered the basement of the Dallas Police Department
    shortly after 11:17 a.m. and killed Lee Harvey Oswald at 11:21
    a.m.

    (_b_) Although the evidence on Ruby’s means of entry is not
    conclusive, the weight of the evidence indicates that he walked
    down the ramp leading from Main Street to the basement of the
    police department.

    (_c_) There is no evidence to support the rumor that Ruby
    may have been assisted by any members of the Dallas Police
    Department in the killing of Oswald.

    (_d_) The Dallas Police Department’s decision to transfer
    Oswald to the county jail in full public view was unsound.
    The arrangements made by the police department on Sunday
    morning, only a few hours before the attempted transfer, were
    inadequate. Of critical importance was the fact that news media
    representatives and others were not excluded from the basement
    even after the police were notified of threats to Oswald’s
    life. These deficiencies contributed to the death of Lee Harvey
    Oswald.

9. The Commission has found no evidence that either Lee Harvey Oswald
or Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign, to
assassinate President Kennedy. The reasons for this conclusion are:

    (_a_) The Commission has found no evidence that anyone assisted
    Oswald in planning or carrying out the assassination. In this
    connection it has thoroughly investigated, among other factors,
    the circumstances surrounding the planning of the motorcade
    route through Dallas, the hiring of Oswald by the Texas School
    Book Depository Co. on October 15, 1963, the method by which
    the rifle was brought into the building, the placing of cartons
    of books at the window, Oswald’s escape from the building, and
    the testimony of eyewitnesses to the shooting.

    (_b_) The Commission has found no evidence that Oswald
    was involved with any person or group in a conspiracy to
    assassinate the President, although it has thoroughly
    investigated, in addition to other possible leads, all facets
    of Oswald’s associations, finances, and personal habits,
    particularly during the period following his return from the
    Soviet Union in June 1962.

    (_c_) The Commission has found no evidence to show that
    Oswald was employed, persuaded, or encouraged by any foreign
    government to assassinate President Kennedy or that he was an
    agent of any foreign government, although the Commission has
    reviewed the circumstances surrounding Oswald’s defection to
    the Soviet Union, his life there from October of 1959 to June
    of 1962 so far as it can be reconstructed, his known contacts
    with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and his visits to the
    Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City during his trip to
    Mexico from September 26 to October 3, 1963, and his known
    contacts with the Soviet Embassy in the United States.

    (_d_) The Commission has explored all attempts of Oswald to
    identify himself with various political groups, including the
    Communist Party, U. S. A., the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,
    and the Socialist Workers Party, and has been unable to find
    any evidence that the contacts which he initiated were related
    to Oswald’s subsequent assassination of the President.

    (_e_) All of the evidence before the Commission established
    that there was nothing to support the speculation that Oswald
    was an agent, employee, or informant of the FBI, the CIA, or
    any other governmental agency. It has thoroughly investigated
    Oswald’s relationships prior to the assassination with all
    agencies of the U. S. Government. All contacts with Oswald by
    any of these agencies were made in the regular exercise of
    their different responsibilities.

    (_f_) No direct or indirect relationship between Lee Harvey
    Oswald and Jack Ruby has been discovered by the Commission, nor
    has it been able to find any credible evidence that either knew
    the other, although a thorough investigation was made of the
    many rumors and speculations of such a relationship.

    (_g_) The Commission has found no evidence that Jack Ruby acted
    with any other person in the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald.

    (_h_) After careful investigation the Commission has found no
    credible evidence either that Ruby and Officer Tippit, who was
    killed by Oswald, knew each other or that Oswald and Tippit
    knew each other.

    Because of the difficulty of proving negatives to a certainty
    the possibility of others being involved with either Oswald
    or Ruby cannot be established categorically, but if there is
    any such evidence it has been beyond the reach of all the
    investigative agencies and resources of the United States and
    has not come to the attention of this Commission.

10. In its entire investigation the Commission has found no evidence of
conspiracy, subversion, or disloyalty to the U. S. Government by any
Federal, State, or local official.

11. On the basis of the evidence before the Commission it concludes
that Oswald acted alone. Therefore, to determine the motives for the
assassination of President Kennedy, one must look to the assassin
himself. Clues to Oswald’s motives can be found in his family
history, his education or lack of it, his acts, his writings, and the
recollections of those who had close contacts with him throughout
his life. The Commission has presented with this report all of the
background information bearing on motivation which it could discover.
Thus, others may study Lee Oswald’s life and arrive at their own
conclusions as to his possible motives.

The Commission could not make any definitive determination of Oswald’s
motives. It has endeavored to isolate factors which contributed to his
character and which might have influenced his decision to assassinate
President Kennedy. These factors were:

    (_a_) His deep-rooted resentment of all authority which was
    expressed in a hostility toward every society in which he lived;

    (_b_) His inability to enter into meaningful relationships with
    people, and a continuous pattern of rejecting his environment
    in favor of new surroundings;

    (_c_) His urge to try to find a place in history and despair at
    times over failures in his various undertakings;

    (_d_) His capacity for violence as evidenced by his attempt to
    kill General Walker;

    (_e_) His avowed commitment to Marxism and communism, as he
    understood the terms and developed his own interpretation of
    them; this was expressed by his antagonism toward the United
    States, by his defection to the Soviet Union, by his failure
    to be reconciled with life in the United States even after
    his disenchantment with the Soviet Union, and by his efforts,
    though frustrated, to go to Cuba.

Each of these contributed to his capacity to risk all in cruel and
irresponsible actions.

12. The Commission recognizes that the varied responsibilities of the
President require that he make frequent trips to all parts of the
United States and abroad. Consistent with their high responsibilities
Presidents can never be protected from every potential threat. The
Secret Service’s difficulty in meeting its protective responsibility
varies with the activities and the nature of the occupant of the
Office of President and his willingness to conform to plans for his
safety. In appraising the performance of the Secret Service it should
be understood that it has to do its work within such limitations.
Nevertheless, the Commission believes that recommendations for
improvements in Presidential protection are compelled by the facts
disclosed in this investigation.

    (_a_) The complexities of the Presidency have increased so
    rapidly in recent years that the Secret Service has not been
    able to develop or to secure adequate resources of personnel
    and facilities to fulfill its important assignment. This
    situation should be promptly remedied.

    (_b_) The Commission has concluded that the criteria and
    procedures of the Secret Service designed to identify and
    protect against persons considered threats to the president,
    were not adequate prior to the assassination.

    (1) The Protective Research Section of the Secret Service,
    which is responsible for its preventive work, lacked sufficient
    trained personnel and the mechanical and technical assistance
    needed to fulfill its responsibility.

    (2) Prior to the assassination the Secret Service’s criteria
    dealt with direct threats against the President. Although the
    Secret Service treated the direct threats against the President
    adequately, it failed to recognize the necessity of identifying
    other potential sources of danger to his security. The Secret
    Service did not develop adequate and specific criteria defining
    those persons or groups who might present a danger to the
    President. In effect, the Secret Service largely relied upon
    other Federal or State agencies to supply the information
    necessary for it to fulfill its preventive responsibilities,
    although it did ask for information about direct threats to the
    President.

    (_c_) The Commission has concluded that there was insufficient
    liaison and coordination of information between the Secret
    Service and other Federal agencies necessarily concerned with
    Presidential protection. Although the FBI, in the normal
    exercise of its responsibility, had secured considerable
    information about Lee Harvey Oswald, it had no official
    responsibility, under the Secret Service criteria existing
    at the time of the President’s trip to Dallas, to refer to
    the Secret Service the information it had about Oswald. The
    Commission has concluded, however, that the FBI took an unduly
    restrictive view of its role in preventive intelligence work
    prior to the assassination. A more carefully coordinated
    treatment of the Oswald case by the FBI might well have
    resulted in bringing Oswald’s activities to the attention of
    the Secret Service.

    (_d_) The Commission has concluded that some of the advance
    preparations in Dallas made by the Secret Service, such as the
    detailed security measures taken at Love Field and the Trade
    Mart, were thorough and well executed. In other respects,
    however, the Commission has concluded that the advance
    preparations for the President’s trip were deficient.

    (1) Although the Secret Service is compelled to rely to a great
    extent on local law enforcement officials, its procedures at
    the time of the Dallas trip did not call for well-defined
    instructions as to the respective responsibilities of the
    police officials and others assisting in the protection of the
    President.

    (2) The procedures relied upon by the Secret Service for
    detecting the presence of an assassin located in a building
    along a motorcade route were inadequate. At the time of the
    trip to Dallas, the Secret Service as a matter of practice did
    not investigate, or cause to be checked, any building located
    along the motorcade route to be taken by the President. The
    responsibility for observing windows in these buildings during
    the motorcade was divided between local police personnel
    stationed on the streets to regulate crowds and Secret Service
    agents riding in the motorcade. Based on its investigation the
    Commission has concluded that these arrangements during the
    trip to Dallas were clearly not sufficient.

    (_e_) The configuration of the Presidential car and the seating
    arrangements of the Secret Service agents in the car did not
    afford the Secret Service agents the opportunity they should
    have had to be of immediate assistance to the President at the
    first sign of danger.

    (_f_) Within these limitations, however, the Commission
    finds that the agents most immediately responsible for the
    President’s safety reacted promptly at the time the shots were
    fired from the Texas School Book Depository Building.


RECOMMENDATIONS

Prompted by the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service
has initiated a comprehensive and critical review of its total
operations. As a result of studies conducted during the past several
months, and in cooperation with this Commission, the Secret Service has
prepared a planning document dated August 27, 1964, which recommends
various programs considered necessary by the Service to improve its
techniques and enlarge its resources. The Commission is encouraged by
the efforts taken by the Secret Service since the assassination and
suggests the following recommendations.

1. A committee of Cabinet members including the Secretary of the
Treasury and the Attorney General, or the National Security Council,
should be assigned the responsibility of reviewing and overseeing the
protective activities of the Secret Service and the other Federal
agencies that assist in safeguarding the President. Once given this
responsibility, such a committee would insure that the maximum
resources of the Federal Government are fully engaged in the task of
protecting the President, and would provide guidance in defining the
general nature of domestic and foreign dangers to Presidential security.

2. Suggestions have been advanced to the Commission for the transfer
of all or parts of the Presidential protective responsibilities of
the Secret Service to some other department or agency. The Commission
believes that if there is to be any determination of whether or not to
relocate these responsibilities and functions, it ought to be made by
the Executive and the Congress, perhaps upon recommendations based on
studies by the previously suggested committee.

3. Meanwhile, in order to improve daily supervision of the Secret
Service within the Department of the Treasury, the Commission
recommends that the Secretary of the Treasury appoint a special
assistant with the responsibility of supervising the Secret Service.
This special assistant should have sufficient stature and experience in
law enforcement, intelligence, and allied fields to provide effective
continuing supervision, and to keep the Secretary fully informed
regarding the performance of the Secret Service. One of the initial
assignments of this special assistant should be the supervision of the
current effort by the Secret Service to revise and modernize its basic
operating procedures.

4. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service completely
overhaul its facilities devoted to the advance detection of potential
threats against the President. The Commission suggests the following
measures.

    (_a_) The Secret Service should develop as quickly as possible
    more useful and precise criteria defining those potential
    threats to the President which should be brought to its
    attention by other agencies. The criteria should, among other
    additions, provide for prompt notice to the Secret Service of
    all returned defectors.

    (_b_) The Secret Service should expedite its current plans to
    utilize the most efficient data-processing techniques.

    (_c_) Once the Secret Service has formulated new criteria
    delineating the information it desires, it should enter into
    agreements with each Federal agency to insure its receipt of
    such information.

5. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service improve the
protective measures followed in the planning, and conducting of
Presidential motorcades. In particular, the Secret Service should
continue its current efforts to increase the precautionary attention
given to buildings along the motorcade route.

6. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service continue its
recent efforts to improve and formalize its relationships with local
police departments in areas to be visited by the President.

7. The Commission believes that when the new criteria and procedures
are established, the Secret Service will not have sufficient personnel
or adequate facilities. The Commission recommends that the Secret
Service be provided with the personnel and resources which the Service
and the Department of the Treasury may be able to demonstrate are
needed to fulfill its important mission.

8. Even with an increase in Secret Service personnel, the protection of
the President will continue to require the resources and cooperation of
many Federal agencies. The Commission recommends that these agencies,
specifically the FBI, continue the practice as it has developed,
particularly since the assassination, of assisting the Secret Service
upon request by providing personnel or other aid, and that there be
a closer association and liaison between the Secret Service and all
Federal agencies.

9. The Commission recommends that the President’s physician always
accompany him during his travels and occupy a position near the
President where he can be immediately available in case of any
emergency.

10. The Commission recommends to Congress that it adopt legislation
which would make the assassination of the President and Vice President
a Federal crime. A state of affairs where U.S. authorities have no
clearly defined jurisdiction to investigate the assassination of a
President is anomalous.

11. The Commission has examined the Department of State’s handling
of the Oswald matters and finds that it followed the law throughout.
However, the Commission believes that the Department in accordance
with its own regulations should in all cases exercise great care in
the return to this country of defectors who have evidenced disloyalty
or hostility to this country or who have expressed a desire to
renounce their American citizenship and that when such persons are so
returned, procedures should be adopted for the better dissemination
of information concerning them to the intelligence agencies of the
Government.

12. The Commission recommends that the representatives of the bar, law
enforcement associations, and the news media work together to establish
ethical standards concerning the collection and presentation of
information to the public so that there will be no interference with
pending criminal investigations, court proceedings, or the right of
individuals to a fair trial.




CHAPTER II

The Assassination


This chapter describes President Kennedy’s trip to Dallas, from its
origin through its tragic conclusion. The narrative of these events
is based largely on the recollections of the participants, although
in many instances documentary or other evidence has also been used by
the Commission. Beginning with the advance plans and Secret Service
preparations for the trip, this chapter reviews the motorcade through
Dallas, the fleeting moments of the assassination, the activities at
Parkland Memorial Hospital, and the return of the Presidential party to
Washington. An evaluation of the procedures employed to safeguard the
President, with recommendations for improving these procedures, appears
in chapter VIII of the report.


PLANNING THE TEXAS TRIP

President Kennedy’s visit to Texas in November 1963 had been under
consideration for almost a year before it occurred. He had made
only a few brief visits to the State since the 1960 Presidential
campaign and in 1962 he began to consider a formal visit.[C2-1]
During 1963, the reasons for making the trip became more persuasive.
As a political leader, the President wished to resolve the factional
controversy within the Democratic Party in Texas before the election
of 1964.[C2-2] The party itself saw an opportunity to raise funds by
having the President speak at a political dinner eventually planned
for Austin.[C2-3] As Chief of State, the President always welcomed the
opportunity to learn, firsthand, about the problems which concerned
the American people.[C2-4] Moreover, he looked forward to the public
appearances which he personally enjoyed.[C2-5]

The basic decision on the November trip to Texas was made at a
meeting of President Kennedy, Vice President Johnson, and Governor
Connally on June 5, 1963, at the Cortez Hotel in El Paso, Tex.[C2-6]
The President had spoken earlier that day at the Air Force Academy
in Colorado Springs, Colo., and had stopped in El Paso to discuss
the proposed visit and other matters with the Vice President and the
Governor.[C2-7] The three agreed that the President would come to Texas
in late November 1963.[C2-8] The original plan called for the President
to spend only 1 day in the State, making whirlwind visits to Dallas,
Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Houston.[C2-9] In September, the White
House decided to permit further visits by the President and extended
the trip to run from the afternoon of November 21 through the evening
of Friday, November 22.[C2-10] When Governor Connally called at the
White House on October 4 to discuss the details of the visit, it was
agreed that the planning of events in Texas would be left largely to
the Governor.[C2-11] At the White House, Kenneth O’Donnell, special
assistant to the President, acted as coordinator for the trip.[C2-12]

Everyone agreed that, if there was sufficient time, a motorcade through
downtown Dallas would be the best way for the people to see their
President. When the trip was planned for only 1 day, Governor Connally
had opposed the motorcade because there was not enough time.[C2-13]
The Governor stated, however, that “once we got San Antonio moved
from Friday to Thursday afternoon, where that was his initial stop
in Texas, then we had the time, and I withdrew my objections to
a motorcade.”[C2-14] According to O’Donnell, “we had a motorcade
wherever we went,” particularly in large cities where the purpose was
to let the President be seen by as many people as possible.[C2-15]
In his experience, “it would be automatic” for the Secret Service
to arrange a route which would, within the time allotted, bring the
President “through an area which exposes him to the greatest number of
people.”[C2-16]


ADVANCE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DALLAS TRIP

Advance preparations for President Kennedy’s visit to Dallas were
primarily the responsibility of two Secret Service agents: Special
Agent Winston G. Lawson, a member of the White House detail who acted
as the advance agent, and Forrest V. Sorrels, special agent in charge
of the Dallas office.[C2-17] Both agents were advised of the trip on
November 4.[C2-18] Lawson received a tentative schedule of the Texas
trip on November 8 from Roy H. Kellerman, assistant special agent in
charge of the White House detail, who was the Secret Service official
responsible for the entire Texas journey.[C2-19] As advance agent
working closely with Sorrels, Lawson had responsibility for arranging
the timetable for the President’s visit to Dallas and coordinating
local activities with the White House staff, the organizations directly
concerned with the visit, and local law enforcement officials.[C2-20]
Lawson’s most important responsibilities were to take preventive
action against anyone in Dallas considered a threat to the President,
to select the luncheon site and motorcade route, and to plan security
measures for the luncheon and the motorcade.


Preventive Intelligence Activities

The Protective Research Section (PRS) of the Secret Service maintains
records of people who have threatened the President or so conducted
themselves as to be deemed a potential danger to him. On November 8,
1963, after undertaking the responsibility for advance preparations
for the visit to Dallas, Agent Lawson went to the PRS offices in
Washington. A check of the geographic indexes there revealed no listing
for any individual deemed to be a potential danger to the President
in the territory of the Secret Service regional office which includes
Dallas and Fort Worth.[C2-21]

To supplement the PRS files, the Secret Service depends largely on
local police departments and local offices of other Federal agencies
which advise it of potential threats immediately before the visit
of the President to their community. Upon his arrival in Dallas on
November 12 Lawson conferred with the local police and the local
office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation about potential dangers
to the President. Although there was no mention in PRS files of the
demonstration in Dallas against Ambassador Adlai Stevenson on October
24, 1963, Lawson inquired about the incident and obtained through the
local police photographs of some of the persons involved.[C2-22] On
November 22 a Secret Service agent stood at the entrance to the Trade
Mart, where the President was scheduled to speak, with copies of these
photographs. Dallas detectives in the lobby of the Trade Mart and in
the luncheon area also had copies of these photographs. A number of
people who resembled some of those in the photographs were placed under
surveillance at the Trade Mart.[C2-23]

The FBI office in Dallas gave the local Secret Service representatives
the name of a possibly dangerous individual in the Dallas area who was
investigated. It also advised the Secret Service of the circulation on
November 21 of a handbill sharply critical of President Kennedy,[C2-24]
discussed in chapter VI of this report. Shortly before, the Dallas
police had reported to the Secret Service that the handbill had
appeared on the streets of Dallas. Neither the Dallas police nor the
FBI had yet learned the source of the handbill.[C2-25] No one else was
identified to the Secret Service through local inquiry as potentially
dangerous, nor did PRS develop any additional information between
November 12, when Lawson left Washington, and November 22. The adequacy
of the intelligence system maintained by the Secret Service at the time
of the assassination, including a detailed description of the available
data on Lee Harvey Oswald and the reasons why his name had not been
furnished to the Secret Service, is discussed in chapter VIII.


The Luncheon Site

An important purpose of the President’s visit to Dallas was to speak at
a luncheon given by business and civic leaders. The White House staff
informed the Secret Service that the President would arrive and depart
from Dallas’ Love Field; that a motorcade through the downtown area of
Dallas to the luncheon site should be arranged; and that following the
luncheon the President would return to the airport by the most direct
route. Accordingly, it was important to determine the luncheon site as
quickly as possible, so that security could be established at the site
and the motorcade route selected.

On November 4, Gerald A. Behn, agent in charge of the White House
detail, asked Sorrels to examine three potential sites for the
luncheon.[C2-26] One building, Market Hall, was unavailable for
November 22. The second, the Women’s Building at the State Fair
Grounds, was a one-story building with few entrances and easy to make
secure, but it lacked necessary food-handling facilities and had
certain unattractive features, including a low ceiling with exposed
conduits and beams. The third possibility, the Trade Mart, a handsome
new building with all the necessary facilities, presented security
problems. It had numerous entrances, several tiers of balconies
surrounding the central court where the luncheon would be held, and
several catwalks crossing the court at each level. On November 4,
Sorrels told Behn he believed security difficulties at the Trade Mart
could be overcome by special precautions.[C2-27] Lawson also evaluated
the security hazards at the Trade Mart on November 13.[C2-28] Kenneth
O’Donnell made the final decision to hold the luncheon at the Trade
Mart; Behn so notified Lawson on November 14.[C2-29]

Once the Trade Mart had been selected, Sorrels and Lawson worked out
detailed arrangements for security at the building. In addition to the
preventive measures already mentioned, they provided for controlling
access to the building, closing off and policing areas around it,
securing the roof and insuring the presence of numerous police
officers inside and around the building. Ultimately more than 200 law
enforcement officers, mainly Dallas police but including 8 Secret
Service agents, were deployed in and around the Trade Mart.[C2-30]


The Motorcade Route

On November 8, when Lawson was briefed on the itinerary for the trip to
Dallas, he was told that 45 minutes had been allotted for a motorcade
procession from Love Field to the luncheon site.[C2-31] Lawson was not
specifically instructed to select the parade route, but he understood
that this was one of his functions.[C2-32] Even before the Trade Mart
had been definitely selected, Lawson and Sorrels began to consider the
best motorcade route from Love Field to the Trade Mart. On November 14,
Lawson and Sorrels attended a meeting at Love Field and on their return
to Dallas drove over the route which Sorrels believed best suited for
the proposed motorcade.[C2-33] This route, eventually selected for the
motorcade from the airport to the Trade Mart, measured 10 miles and
could be driven easily within the allotted 45 minutes.[C2-34] From Love
Field the route passed through a portion of suburban Dallas, through
the downtown area along Main Street and then to the Trade Mart via
Stemmons Freeway. For the President’s return to Love Field following
the luncheon, the agents selected the most direct route, which was
approximately 4 miles.[C2-35]

After the selection of the Trade Mart as the luncheon site, Lawson
and Sorrels met with Dallas Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry, Assistant
Chief Charles Batchelor, Deputy Chief N. T. Fisher, and several other
command officers to discuss details of the motorcade and possible
routes.[C2-36] The route was further reviewed by Lawson and Sorrels
with Assistant Chief Batchelor and members of the local host committee
on November 15. The police officials agreed that the route recommended
by Sorrels was the proper one and did not express a belief that any
other route might be better.[C2-37] On November 18, Sorrels and Lawson
drove over the selected route with Batchelor and other police officers,
verifying that it could be traversed within 45 minutes. Representatives
of the local host committee and the White House staff were advised by
the Secret Service of the actual route on the afternoon of November
18.[C2-38]

The route impressed the agents as a natural and desirable one. Sorrels,
who had participated in Presidential protection assignments in Dallas
since a visit by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936,[C2-39]
testified that the traditional parade route in Dallas was along Main
Street, since the tall buildings along the street gave more people an
opportunity to participate.[C2-40] The route chosen from the airport
to Main Street was the normal one, except where Harwood Street was
selected as the means of access to Main Street in preference to a short
stretch of the Central Expressway, which presented a minor safety
hazard and could not accommodate spectators as conveniently as Harwood
Street.[C2-41] According to Lawson, the chosen route seemed to be the
best.

    It afforded us wide streets most of the way, because of the
    buses that were in the motorcade. It afforded us a chance to
    have alternative routes if something happened on the motorcade
    route. It was the type of suburban area a good part of the way
    where the crowds would be able to be controlled for a great
    distance, and we figured that the largest crowds would be
    downtown, which they were, and that the wide streets that we
    would use downtown would be of sufficient width to keep the
    public out of our way.[C2-42]

Elm Street, parallel to Main Street and one block north, was not used
for the main portion of the downtown part of the motorcade because Main
Street offered better vantage points for spectators.

To reach the Trade Mart from Main Street the agents decided to use
the Stemmons Freeway (Route No. 77), the most direct route. The only
practical way for westbound traffic on Main Street to reach the
northbound lanes of the Stemmons Freeway is via Elm Street, which
Route No. 77 traffic is instructed to follow in this part of the
city. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2113, p. 34.) Elm Street was to be
reached from Main by turning right at Houston, going one block north
and then turning left onto Elm. On this last portion of the journey,
only 5 minutes from the Trade Mart, the President’s motorcade would
pass the Texas School Book Depository Building on the northwest corner
of Houston and Elm Streets. The building overlooks Dealey Plaza,
an attractively landscaped triangle of 3 acres. (See Commission
Exhibit No. 876, p. 33.) From Houston Street, which forms the base
of the triangle, three streets--Commerce, Main, and Elm--trisect
the plaza, converging at the apex of the triangle to form a triple
underpass beneath a multiple railroad bridge almost 500 feet from
Houston Street.[C2-43] Elm Street, the northernmost of the three,
after intersecting Houston curves in a southwesterly arc through the
underpass and leads into an access road, which branches off to the
right and is used by traffic going to the Stemmons Freeway and the
Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 2113-2116,
pp. 34-37.)

The Elm Street approach to the Stemmons Freeway is necessary in order
to avoid the traffic hazards which would otherwise exist if right
turns were permitted from both Main and Elm into the freeway. To
create this traffic pattern, a concrete barrier between Main and Elm
Streets presents an obstacle to a right turn from Main across Elm to
the access road to Stemmons Freeway and the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike.
This concrete barrier extends far enough beyond the access road to
make it impracticable for vehicles to turn right from Main directly to
the access road. A sign located on this barrier instructs Main Street
traffic not to make any turns.[C2-45] (See Commission Exhibits Nos.
2114-2116, pp. 35-37.) In conformity with these arrangements, traffic
proceeding west on Main is directed to turn right at Houston in order
to reach the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike, which has the same access road
from Elm Street as does the Stemmons Freeway.[C2-46] (See Commission
Exhibit No. 2967, p. 38.)

The planning for the motorcade also included advance preparations for
security arrangements along the route. Sorrels and Lawson reviewed the
route in cooperation with Assistant Chief Batchelor and other Dallas
police officials who took notes on the requirements for controlling the
crowds and traffic, watching the overpasses, and providing motorcycle
escort.[C2-47] To control traffic, arrangements were made for the
deployment of foot patrolmen and motorcycle police at various positions
along the route.[C2-48] Police were assigned to each overpass on the
route and instructed to keep them clear of unauthorized persons.[C2-49]
No arrangements were made for police or building custodians to inspect
buildings along the motorcade route since the Secret Service did
not normally request or make such a check.[C2-50] Under standard
procedures, the responsibility for watching the windows of buildings
was shared by local police stationed along the route and Secret Service
agents riding in the motorcade.[C2-51]

As the date for the President’s visit approached, the two Dallas
newspapers carried several reports of his motorcade route. The
selection of the Trade Mart as the possible site for the luncheon first
appeared in the Dallas Times-Herald on November 15, 1963.[C2-52] The
following day, the newspaper reported that the Presidential party
“apparently will loop through the downtown area, probably on Main
Street, en route from Dallas Love Field” on its way to the Trade
Mart.[C2-53] On November 19, the Times-Herald afternoon paper detailed
the precise route:

    From the airport, the President’s party will proceed to
    Mockingbird Lane to Lemmon and then to Turtle Creek, turning
    south to Cedar Springs.

    The motorcade will then pass through downtown on Harwood and
    then west on Main, turning back to Elm at Houston and then out
    Stemmons Freeway to the Trade Mart.[C2-54]

Also on November 19, the Morning News reported that the President’s
motorcade would travel from Love Field along specified streets, then
“Harwood to Main, Main to Houston, Houston to Elm, Elm under the Triple
Underpass to Stemmons Freeway, and on to the Trade Mart.”[C2-55] On
November 20 a front page story reported that the streets on which
the Presidential motorcade would travel included “Main and Stemmons
Freeway.”[C2-56] On the morning of the President’s arrival, the Morning
News noted that the motorcade would travel through downtown Dallas onto
the Stemmons Freeway, and reported that “the motorcade will move slowly
so that crowds can ‘get a good view’ of President Kennedy and his
wife.”[C2-57]


DALLAS BEFORE THE VISIT

The President’s intention to pay a visit to Texas in the fall of 1963
aroused interest throughout the State. The two Dallas newspapers
provided their readers with a steady stream of information and
speculation about the trip, beginning on September 13, when the
Times-Herald announced in a front page article that President Kennedy
was planning a brief 1-day tour of four Texas cities--Dallas, Fort
Worth, San Antonio, and Houston.[C2-58] Both Dallas papers cited White
House sources on September 26 as confirming the President’s intention
to visit Texas on November 21 and 22, with Dallas scheduled as one of
the stops.[C2-59]

Articles, editorials, and letters to the editor in the Dallas Morning
News and the Dallas Times-Herald after September 13 reflected the
feeling in the community toward the forthcoming Presidential visit.
Although there were critical editorials and letters to the editors, the
news stories reflected the desire of Dallas officials to welcome the
President with dignity and courtesy. An editorial in the Times-Herald
of September 17 called on the people of Dallas to be “congenial
hosts” even though “Dallas didn’t vote for Mr. Kennedy in 1960, may
not endorse him in ’64.”[C2-60] On October 3 the Dallas Morning News
quoted U.S. Representative Joe Pool’s hope that President Kennedy would
receive a “good welcome” and would not face demonstrations like those
encountered by Vice President Johnson during the 1960 campaign.[C2-61]

Increased concern about the President’s visit was aroused by the
incident involving the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai
E. Stevenson. On the evening of October 24, 1963, after addressing
a meeting in Dallas, Stevenson was jeered, jostled, and spat upon
by hostile demonstrators outside the Dallas Memorial Auditorium
Theater.[C2-62] The local, national, and international reaction to
this incident evoked from Dallas officials and newspapers strong
condemnations of the demonstrators. Mayor Earle Cabell called on the
city to redeem itself during President Kennedy’s visit.[C2-63] He
asserted that Dallas had shed its reputation of the twenties as the
“Southwest hate capital of Dixie.”[C2-64] On October 26 the press
reported Chief of Police Curry’s plans to call in 100 extra off-duty
officers to help protect President Kennedy.[C2-65] Any thought that
the President might cancel his visit to Dallas was ended when Governor
Connally confirmed on November 8 that the President would come to Texas
on November 21-22, and that he would visit San Antonio, Houston, Fort
Worth, Dallas, and Austin.[C2-66]

During November the Dallas papers reported frequently on the plans
for protecting the President, stressing the thoroughness of the
preparations. They conveyed the pleas of Dallas leaders that citizens
not demonstrate or create disturbances during the President’s visit.
On November 18 the Dallas City Council adopted a new city ordinance
prohibiting interference with attendance at lawful assemblies.[C2-67]
Two days before the President’s arrival Chief Curry warned that the
Dallas police would not permit improper conduct during the President’s
visit.[C2-68]

Meanwhile, on November 17 the president of the Dallas Chamber of
Commerce referred to the city’s reputation for being the friendliest
town in America and asserted that citizens would “greet the President
of the United States with the warmth and pride that keep the Dallas
spirit famous the world over.”[C2-69] Two days later, a local
Republican leader called for a “civilized nonpartisan” welcome for
President Kennedy, stating that “in many respects Dallas County has
isolated itself from the main stream of life in the world in this
decade.”[C2-70]

Another reaction to the impending visit--hostile to the President--came
to a head shortly before his arrival. On November 21 there appeared
on the streets of Dallas the anonymous handbill mentioned above. It
was fashioned after the “wanted” circulars issued by law enforcement
agencies. Beneath two photographs of President Kennedy, one fullface
and one profile, appeared the caption, “Wanted for Treason,” followed
by a scurrilous bill of particulars that constituted a vilification of
the President.[C2-71] And on the morning of the President’s arrival,
there appeared in the Morning News a full page, black-bordered
advertisement headed “Welcome Mr. Kennedy to Dallas,” sponsored by
the American Factfinding Committee, which the sponsor later testified
was an ad hoc committee “formed strictly for the purpose of having
a name to put in the paper.”[C2-72] The “welcome” consisted of a
series of statements and questions critical of the President and his
administration.[C2-73] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1031, p. 294.)


VISITS TO OTHER TEXAS CITIES

The trip to Texas began with the departure of President and Mrs.
Kennedy from the White House by helicopter at 10:45 a.m., e.s.t., on
November 21, 1963, for Andrews AFB. They took off in the Presidential
plane, _Air Force One_, at 11 a.m., arriving at San Antonio at 1:30
p.m., c.s.t. They were greeted by Vice President Johnson and Governor
Connally, who joined the Presidential party in a motorcade through San
Antonio.[C2-74] During the afternoon, President Kennedy dedicated the
U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks AFB.[C2-75] Late
in the afternoon he flew to Houston where he rode through the city in a
motorcade, spoke at the Rice University Stadium, and attended a dinner
in honor of U.S. Representative Albert Thomas.[C2-76]

At Rice Stadium a very large, enthusiastic crowd greeted the
President.[C2-77] In Houston, as elsewhere during the trip, the
crowds showed much interest in Mrs. Kennedy. David F. Powers of the
President’s staff later stated that when the President asked for his
assessment of the day’s activities, Powers replied “that the crowd was
about the same as the one which came to see him before but there were
100,000 extra people on hand who came to see Mrs. Kennedy.”[C2-78] Late
in the evening, the Presidential party flew to Fort Worth where they
spent the night at the Texas Hotel.[C2-79]

On the morning of November 22, President Kennedy attended a breakfast
at the hotel and afterward addressed a crowd at an open parking
lot.[C2-80] The President liked outdoor appearances because more people
could see and hear him.[C2-81] Before leaving the hotel, the President,
Mrs. Kennedy, and Kenneth O’Donnell talked about the risks inherent
in Presidential public appearances.[C2-82] According to O’Donnell,
the President commented that “if anybody really wanted to shoot the
President of the United States, it was not a very difficult job--all
one had to do was get a high building someday with a telescopic
rifle, and there was nothing anybody could do to defend against such
an attempt.”[C2-83] Upon concluding the conversation, the President
prepared to depart for Dallas.


ARRIVAL AT LOVE FIELD

In Dallas the rain had stopped, and by midmorning a gloomy overcast
sky had given way to the bright sunshine that greeted the Presidential
party when _Air Force One_ touched down at Love Field at 11:40
a.m., c.s.t.[C2-84] Governor and Mrs. Connally and Senator Ralph
W. Yarborough had come with the President from Fort Worth.[C2-85]
Vice President Johnson’s airplane, _Air Force Two_, had arrived at
Love Field at approximately 11:35 a.m., and the Vice President and
Mrs. Johnson were in the receiving line to greet President and Mrs.
Kennedy.[C2-86]

After a welcome from the Dallas reception committee, President and Mrs.
Kennedy walked along a chain-link fence at the reception area greeting
a large crowd of spectators that had gathered behind it.[C2-87] Secret
Service agents formed a cordon to keep the press and photographers
from impeding their passage and scanned the crowd for threatening
movements.[C2-88] Dallas police stood at intervals along the fence
and Dallas plainclothesmen mixed in the crowd.[C2-89] Vice President
and Mrs. Johnson followed along the fence, guarded by four members of
the Vice-Presidential detail.[C2-90] Approximately 10 minutes after
the arrival at Love Field, the President and Mrs. Kennedy went to the
Presidential automobile to begin the motorcade.[C2-91]


ORGANIZATION OF THE MOTORCADE

Secret Service arrangements for Presidential trips, which were
followed in the Dallas motorcade, are designed to provide protection
while permitting large numbers of people to see the President.[C2-92]
Every effort is made to prevent unscheduled stops, although the
President may, and in Dallas did, order stops in order to greet the
public.[C2-93] When the motorcade slows or stops, agents take positions
between the President and the crowd.[C2-94]

The order of vehicles in the Dallas motorcade was as follows:

_Motorcycles._--Dallas police motorcycles preceded the pilot car.[C2-95]

_The pilot car._--Manned by officers of the Dallas Police Department,
this automobile preceded the main party by approximately a quarter
of a mile. Its function was to alert police along the route that the
motorcade was approaching and to check for signs of trouble.[C2-96]

_Motorcycles._--Next came four to six motorcycle policemen whose main
purpose was to keep the crowd back.[C2-97]

_The lead car._--Described as a “rolling command car,” this was an
unmarked Dallas police car, driven by Chief of Police Curry and
occupied by Secret Service Agents Sorrels and Lawson and by Dallas
County Sheriff J. E. Decker. The occupants scanned the crowd and the
buildings along the route. Their main function was to spot trouble
in advance and to direct any necessary steps to meet the trouble.
Following normal practice, the lead automobile stayed approximately
four to five car lengths ahead of the President’s limousine.[C2-98]

_The Presidential limousine._--The President’s automobile was a
specially designed 1961 Lincoln convertible with two collapsible jump
seats between the front and rear seats.[C2-99] (See Commission Exhibit
No. 346, p. 44.) It was outfitted with a clear plastic bubble-top
which was neither bulletproof nor bullet resistant.[C2-100] Because
the skies had cleared in Dallas, Lawson directed that the top not be
used for the day’s activities. He acted on instructions he had received
earlier from Assistant Special Agent in Charge Roy H. Kellerman, who
was in Fort Worth with the President.[C2-101] Kellerman had discussed
the matter with O’Donnell, whose instructions were, “If the weather
is clear and it is not raining, have that bubbletop off.”[C2-102]
Elevated approximately 15 inches above the back of the front seat was
a metallic frame with four handholds that riders in the car could grip
while standing in the rear seat during parades.[C2-103] At the rear on
each side of the automobile were small running boards, each designed
to hold a Secret Service agent, with a metallic handle for the rider
to grasp.[C2-104] The President had frequently stated that he did not
want agents to ride on these steps during a motorcade except when
necessary. He had repeated this wish only a few days before, during his
visit to Tampa, Fla.[C2-105]

[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 346

Interior of Presidential limousine used on November 22, 1963.]

President Kennedy rode on the right-hand side of the rear seat with
Mrs. Kennedy on his left.[C2-106] Governor Connally occupied the right
jump seat, Mrs. Connally the left.[C2-107] Driving the Presidential
limousine was Special Agent William R. Greer of the Secret Service; on
his right sat Kellerman.[C2-108] Kellerman’s responsibilities included
maintaining radio communications with the lead and followup cars,
scanning the route, and getting out and standing near the President
when the cars stopped.

_Motorcycles._--Four motorcycles, two on each side, flanked the rear
of the Presidential car. They provided some cover for the President,
but their main purpose was to keep back the crowd.[C2-109] On previous
occasions, the President had requested that, to the extent possible,
these flanking motorcycles keep back from the sides of his car.[C2-110]

_Presidential followup car._--This vehicle, a 1955 Cadillac
eight-passenger convertible especially outfitted for the Secret
Service, followed closely behind the President’s automobile.[C2-111]
It carried eight Secret Service agents--two in the front seat, two in
the rear, and two on each of the right and left running boards.[C2-112]
Each agent carried a .38-caliber pistol, and a shotgun and automatic
rifle were also available.[C2-113] Presidential Assistants David F.
Powers and Kenneth O’Donnell sat in the right and left jump seats,
respectively.[C2-114]

The agents in this car, under established procedure, had instructions
to watch the route for signs of trouble, scanning not only the
crowds but the windows and roofs of buildings, overpasses, and
crossings.[C2-115] They were instructed to watch particularly for
thrown objects, sudden actions in the crowd, and any movements toward
the Presidential car.[C2-116] The agents on the front of the running
boards had directions to move immediately to positions just to the
rear of the President and Mrs. Kennedy when the President’s car slowed
to a walking pace or stopped, or when the press of the crowd made it
impossible for the escort motorcycles to stay in position on the car’s
rear flanks.[C2-117] The two agents on the rear of the running boards
were to advance toward the front of the President’s car whenever it
stopped or slowed down sufficiently for them to do so.[C2-118]

_Vice-Presidential car._--The Vice-Presidential automobile, a four-door
Lincoln convertible obtained locally for use in the motorcade,
proceeded approximately two to three car lengths behind the President’s
followup car.[C2-119] This distance was maintained so that spectators
would normally turn their gaze from the President’s automobile by
the time the Vice President came into view.[C2-120] Vice President
Johnson sat on the right-hand side of the rear seat, Mrs. Johnson
in the center, and Senator Yarborough on the left.[C2-121] Rufus W.
Youngblood, special agent in charge of the Vice President’s detail,
occupied the right-hand side of the front seat, and Hurchel Jacks of
the Texas State Highway patrol was the driver.[C2-122]

_Vice-Presidential followup car._--Driven by an officer of the Dallas
Police Department, this vehicle was occupied by three Secret Service
agents and Clifton C. Carter, assistant to the Vice President.[C2-123]
These agents performed for the Vice President the same functions that
the agents in the Presidential followup car performed for the President.

_Remainder of motorcade._--The remainder of the motorcade consisted
of five cars for other dignitaries, including the mayor of Dallas
and Texas Congressmen, telephone and Western Union vehicles, a White
House communications car, three cars for press photographers, an
official party bus for White House staff members and others, and two
press buses. Admiral George G. Burkley, physician to the President,
was in a car following those “containing the local and national
representatives.”[C2-124]

_Police car and motorcycles._[C2-125]--A Dallas police car and several
motorcycles at the rear kept the motorcade together and prevented
unauthorized vehicles from joining the motorcade.

_Communications in the motorcade._[C2-126]--A base station at a fixed
location in Dallas operated a radio network which linked together the
lead car, Presidential car, Presidential followup car, White House
communications car, Trade Mart, Love Field, and the Presidential
and Vice-Presidential airplanes. The Vice-Presidential car and
Vice-Presidential followup car used portable sets with a separate
frequency for their own car-to-car communication.


THE DRIVE THROUGH DALLAS

The motorcade left Love Field shortly after 11:50 a.m. and drove at
speeds up to 25 to 30 miles an hour through thinly populated areas on
the outskirts of Dallas.[C2-127] At the President’s direction, his
automobile stopped twice, the first time to permit him to respond to
a sign asking him to shake hands.[C2-128] During this brief stop,
agents in the front positions on the running boards of the Presidential
followup car came forward and stood beside the President’s car,
looking out toward the crowd, and Special Agent Kellerman assumed his
position next to the car.[C2-129] On the other occasion, the President
halted the motorcade to speak to a Catholic nun and a group of small
children.[C2-130]

In the downtown area, large crowds of spectators gave the President a
tremendous reception.[C2-131] The crowds were so dense that Special
Agent Clinton J. Hill had to leave the left front running board of
the President’s followup car four times to ride on the rear of the
President’s limousine.[C2-132] (See Commission Exhibit No. 698, p. 47.)
Several times Special Agent John D. Ready came forward from the right
front running board of the Presidential followup car to the right side
of the President’s car.[C2-133] Special Agent Glen A. Bennett once left
his place inside the followup car to help keep the crowd away from
the President’s car. When a teenage boy ran toward the rear of the
President’s car,[C2-134] Ready left the running board to chase the boy
back into the crowd. On several occasions when the Vice President’s
car was slowed down by the throng, Special Agent Youngblood stepped out
to hold the crowd back.[C2-135]

[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 698

Presidential limousine in Dallas motorcade.]

According to plan, the President’s motorcade proceeded west through
downtown Dallas on Main Street to the intersection of Houston Street,
which marks the beginning of Dealey Plaza.[C2-136] From Main Street
the motorcade turned right and went north on Houston Street, passing
tall buildings on the right, and headed toward the Texas School
Book Depository Building.[C2-137] The spectators were still thickly
congregated in front of the buildings which lined the east side of
Houston Street, but the crowd thinned abruptly along Elm Street, which
curves in a southwesterly direction as it proceeds downgrade toward the
Triple Underpass and the Stemmons Freeway.[C2-138]

As the motorcade approached the intersection of Houston and Elm
Streets, there was general gratification in the Presidential party
about the enthusiastic reception. Evaluating the political overtones,
Kenneth O’Donnell was especially pleased because it convinced him
that the average Dallas resident was like other American citizens in
respecting and admiring the President.[C2-139] Mrs. Connally, elated by
the reception, turned to President Kennedy and said, “Mr. President,
you can’t say Dallas doesn’t love you.” The President replied, “That is
very obvious.”[C2-140]


THE ASSASSINATION

At 12:30 p.m., c.s.t., as the President’s open limousine proceeded at
approximately 11 miles per hour along Elm Street toward the Triple
Underpass, shots fired from a rifle mortally wounded President Kennedy
and seriously injured Governor Connally. One bullet passed through the
President’s neck; a subsequent bullet, which was lethal, shattered the
right side of his skull. Governor Connally sustained bullet wounds in
his back, the right side of his chest, right wrist, and left thigh.


The Time

The exact time of the assassination was fixed by the testimony of four
witnesses. Special Agent Rufus W. Youngblood observed that the large
electric sign clock atop the Texas School Book Depository Building
showed the numerals “12:30” as the Vice-Presidential automobile
proceeded north on Houston Street, a few seconds before the shots were
fired.[C2-141] Just prior to the shooting, David F. Powers, riding in
the Secret Service followup car, remarked to Kenneth O’Donnell that
it was 12:30 p.m., the time they were due at the Trade Mart.[C2-142]
Seconds after the shooting, Roy Kellerman, riding in the front seat
of the Presidential limousine, looked at his watch and said “12:30”
to the driver, Special Agent Greer.[C2-143] The Dallas police radio
log reflects that Chief of Police Curry reported the shooting of the
President and issued his initial orders at 12:30 p.m.[C2-144]


Speed of the Limousine

William Greer, operator of the Presidential limousine, estimated
the car’s speed at the time of the first shot as 12 to 15 miles per
hour.[C2-145] Other witnesses in the motorcade estimated the speed
of the President’s limousine from 7 to 22 miles per hour.[C2-146] A
more precise determination has been made from motion pictures taken
on the scene by an amateur photographer, Abraham Zapruder. Based on
these films, the speed of the President’s automobile is computed at an
average speed of 11.2 miles per hour. The car maintained this average
speed over a distance of approximately 136 feet immediately preceding
the shot which struck the President in the head. While the car traveled
this distance, the Zapruder camera ran 152 frames. Since the camera
operates at a speed of 18.3 frames per second, it was calculated that
the car required 8.3 seconds to cover the 136 feet. This represents a
speed of 11.2 miles per hour.[C2-147]


In the Presidential Limousine

Mrs. John F. Kennedy, on the left of the rear seat of the limousine,
looked toward her left and waved to the crowds along the route. Soon
after the motorcade turned onto Elm Street, she heard a sound similar
to a motorcycle noise and a cry from Governor Connally, which caused
her to look to her right. On turning she saw a quizzical look on her
husband’s face as he raised his left hand to his throat. Mrs. Kennedy
then heard a second shot and saw the President’s skull torn open under
the impact of the bullet. As she cradled her mortally wounded husband,
Mrs. Kennedy cried, “Oh, my God, they have shot my husband. I love you,
Jack.”[C2-148]

Governor Connally testified that he recognized the first noise as a
rifle shot and the thought immediately crossed his mind that it was
an assassination attempt. From his position in the right jump seat
immediately in front of the President, he instinctively turned to his
right because the shot appeared to come from over his right shoulder.
Unable to see the President as he turned to the right, the Governor
started to look back over his left shoulder, but he never completed the
turn because he felt something strike him in the back.[C2-149] In his
testimony before the Commission, Governor Connally was certain that he
was hit by the second shot, which he stated he did not hear.[C2-150]

Mrs. Connally, too, heard a frightening noise from her right. Looking
over her right shoulder, she saw that the President had both hands
at his neck but she observed no blood and heard nothing. She watched
as he slumped down with an empty expression on his face.[C2-151] Roy
Kellerman, in the right front seat of the limousine, heard a report
like a firecracker pop. Turning to his right in the direction of the
noise, Kellerman heard the President say “My God, I am hit,” and saw
both of the President’s hands move up toward his neck. As he told the
driver, “Let’s get out of here; we are hit,” Kellerman grabbed his
microphone and radioed ahead to the lead car, “We are hit. Get us to
the hospital immediately.”[C2-152]

The driver, William Greer, heard a noise which he took to be a backfire
from one of the motorcycles flanking the Presidential car. When he
heard the same noise again, Greer glanced over his shoulder and saw
Governor Connally fall. At the sound of the second shot he realized
that something was wrong, and he pressed down on the accelerator as
Kellerman said, “Get out of here fast.”[C2-153] As he issued his
instructions to Greer and to the lead car, Kellerman heard a “flurry
of shots” within 5 seconds of the first noise. According to Kellerman,
Mrs. Kennedy then cried out: “What are they doing to you?” Looking back
from the front seat, Kellerman saw Governor Connally in his wife’s
lap and Special Agent Clinton J. Hill lying across the trunk of the
car.[C2-154]

Mrs. Connally heard a second shot fired and pulled her husband down
into her lap.[C2-155] Observing his blood-covered chest as he was
pulled into his wife’s lap, Governor Connally believed himself mortally
wounded. He cried out, “Oh, no, no, no. My God, they are going to kill
us all.”[C2-156] At first Mrs. Connally thought that her husband had
been killed, but then she noticed an almost imperceptible movement
and knew that he was still alive. She said, “It’s all right. Be
still.”[C2-157] The Governor was lying with his head on his wife’s lap
when he heard a shot hit the President.[C2-158] At that point, both
Governor and Mrs. Connally observed brain tissue splattered over the
interior of the car.[C2-159] According to Governor and Mrs. Connally,
it was after this shot that Kellerman issued his emergency instructions
and the car accelerated.[C2-160]


Reaction by Secret Service Agents

From the left front running board of the President’s followup car,
Special Agent Hill was scanning the few people standing on the south
side of Elm Street after the motorcade had turned off Houston Street.
He estimated that the motorcade had slowed down to approximately 9 or
10 miles per hour on the turn at the intersection of Houston and Elm
Streets and then proceeded at a rate of 12 to 15 miles per hour with
the followup car trailing the President’s automobile by approximately
5 feet.[C2-161] Hill heard a noise, which seemed to be a firecracker,
coming from his right rear. He immediately looked to his right,
“and, in so doing, my eyes had to cross the Presidential limousine
and I saw President Kennedy grab at himself and lurch forward and to
the left.”[C2-162] Hill jumped from the followup car and ran to the
President’s automobile. At about the time he reached the President’s
automobile, Hill heard a second shot, approximately 5 seconds after the
first, which removed a portion of the President’s head.[C2-163]

At the instant that Hill stepped onto the left rear step of the
President’s automobile and grasped the handhold, the car lurched
forward, causing him to lose his footing. He ran three or four steps,
regained his position and mounted the car. Between the time he
originally seized the handhold and the time he mounted the car, Hill
recalled that--

    Mrs. Kennedy had jumped up from the seat and was, it appeared
    to me, reaching for something coming off the right rear bumper
    of the car, the right rear tail, when she noticed that I was
    trying to climb on the car. She turned toward me and I grabbed
    her and put her back in the back seat, crawled up on top of the
    back seat and lay there.[C2-164]

David Powers, who witnessed the scene from the President’s followup
car, stated that Mrs. Kennedy would probably have fallen off the rear
end of the car and been killed if Hill had not pushed her back into the
Presidential automobile.[C2-165] Mrs. Kennedy had no recollection of
climbing onto the back of the car.[C2-166]

Special Agent Ready, on the right front running board of the
Presidential followup car, heard noises that sounded like firecrackers
and ran toward the President’s limousine. But he was immediately called
back by Special Agent Emory P. Roberts, in charge of the followup car,
who did not believe that he could reach the President’s car at the
speed it was then traveling.[C2-167] Special Agent George W. Hickey,
Jr., in the rear seat of the Presidential followup car, picked up and
cocked an automatic rifle as he heard the last shot. At this point the
cars were speeding through the underpass and had left the scene of the
shooting, but Hickey kept the automatic weapon ready as the car raced
to the hospital.[C2-168] Most of the other Secret Service agents in
the motorcade had drawn their sidearms.[C2-169] Roberts noticed that
the Vice President’s car was approximately one-half block behind the
Presidential followup car at the time of the shooting and signaled for
it to move in closer.[C2-170]

Directing the security detail for the Vice President from the right
front seat of the Vice-Presidential car, Special Agent Youngblood
recalled:

    As we were beginning to go down this incline, all of a sudden
    there was an explosive noise. I quickly observed unnatural
    movement of crowds, like ducking or scattering, and quick
    movements in the Presidential followup car. So I turned around
    and hit the Vice President on the shoulder and hollered, get
    down, and then looked around again and saw more of this
    movement, and so I proceeded to go to the back seat and get on
    top of him.[C2-171]

Youngblood was not positive that he was in the rear seat before the
second shot, but thought it probable because of President Johnson’s
statement to that effect immediately after the assassination.[C2-172]
President Johnson emphasized Youngblood’s instantaneous reaction after
the first shot:

    I was startled by the sharp report or explosion, but I had no
    time to speculate as to its origin because Agent Youngblood
    turned in a flash, immediately after the first explosion,
    hitting me on the shoulder, and shouted to all of us in the
    back seat to get down. I was pushed down by Agent Youngblood.
    Almost in the same moment in which he hit or pushed me, he
    vaulted over the back seat and sat on me. I was bent over under
    the weight of Agent Youngblood’s body, toward Mrs. Johnson and
    Senator Yarborough.[C2-173]

Clifton C. Carter, riding in the Vice President’s followup car a short
distance behind, reported that Youngblood was in the rear seat using
his body to shield the Vice President before the second and third shots
were fired.[C2-174]

Other Secret Service agents assigned to the motorcade remained at
their posts during the race to the hospital. None stayed at the scene
of the shooting, and none entered the Texas School Book Depository
Building at or immediately after the shooting. Secret Service procedure
requires that each agent stay with the person being protected and
not be diverted unless it is necessary to accomplish the protective
assignment.[C2-175] Forrest V. Sorrels, special agent in charge of the
Dallas office, was the first Secret Service agent to return to the
scene of the assassination, approximately 20 or 25 minutes after the
shots were fired.[C2-176]


PARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

The Race to the Hospital

In the final instant of the assassination, the Presidential motorcade
began a race to Parkland Memorial Hospital, approximately 4 miles from
the Texas School Book Depository Building.[C2-177] On receipt of the
radio message from Kellerman to the lead car that the President had
been hit, Chief of Police Curry and police motorcyclists at the head
of the motorcade led the way to the hospital.[C2-178] Meanwhile, Chief
Curry ordered the police base station to notify Parkland Hospital that
the wounded President was en route.[C2-179] The radio log of the Dallas
Police Department shows that at 12:30 p.m. on November 22 Chief Curry
radioed, “Go to the hospital--Parkland Hospital. Have them stand by.”
A moment later Curry added, “Looks like the President has been hit.
Have Parkland stand by.” The base station replied, “They have been
notified.”[C2-180] Traveling at speeds estimated at times to be up
to 70 or 80 miles per hour down the Stemmons Freeway and Harry Hines
Boulevard, the Presidential limousine arrived at the emergency entrance
of the Parkland Hospital at about 12:35 p.m.[C2-181] Arriving almost
simultaneously were the President’s followup car, the Vice President’s
automobile, and the Vice President’s followup car. Admiral Burkley, the
President’s physician, arrived at the hospital “between 3 and 5 minutes
following the arrival of the President,” since the riders in his car
“were not exactly aware what had happened” and the car went on to the
Trade Mart first.[C2-182]

When Parkland Hospital received the notification, the staff in
the emergency area was alerted and trauma rooms 1 and 2 were
prepared.[C2-183] These rooms were for the emergency treatment
of acutely ill or injured patients.[C2-184] Although the first
message mentioned an injury only to President Kennedy, two rooms
were prepared.[C2-185] As the President’s limousine sped toward
the hospital, 12 doctors rushed to the emergency area: surgeons,
Drs. Malcolm O. Perry, Charles R. Baxter, Robert N. McClelland,
Ronald C. Jones; the chief neurologist, Dr. William Kemp Clark; 4
anesthesiologists, Drs. Marion T. Jenkins, Adolph H. Giesecke, Jr.,
Jackie H. Hunt, Gene C. Akin; a urological surgeon, Dr Paul C. Peters;
an oral surgeon, Dr. Don T. Curtis; and a heart specialist, Dr. Fouad
A. Bashour.[C2-186]

Upon arriving at Parkland Hospital, Lawson jumped from the lead car and
rushed into the emergency entrance, where he was met by hospital staff
members wheeling stretchers out to the automobile.[C2-187] Special
Agent Hill removed his suit jacket and covered the President’s head
and upper chest to prevent the taking of photographs.[C2-188] Governor
Connally, who had lost consciousness on the ride to the hospital,
regained consciousness when the limousine stopped abruptly at the
emergency entrance. Despite his serious wounds, Governor Connally tried
to get out of the way so that medical help could reach the President.
Although he was reclining in his wife’s arms, he lurched forward in
an effort to stand upright and get out of the car, but he collapsed
again. Then he experienced his first sensation of pain, which became
excruciating.[C2-189] The Governor was lifted onto a stretcher and
taken into trauma room 2.[C2-190] For a moment, Mrs. Kennedy refused to
release the President, whom she held in her lap, but then Kellerman,
Greer, and Lawson lifted the President onto a stretcher and pushed it
into trauma room 1.[C2-191]


Treatment of President Kennedy

The first physician to see the President at Parkland Hospital was Dr.
Charles J. Carrico, a resident in general surgery.[C2-192] Dr. Carrico
was in the emergency area, examining another patient, when he was
notified that President Kennedy was en route to the hospital.[C2-193]
Approximately 2 minutes later, Dr. Carrico saw the President on his
back, being wheeled into the emergency area.[C2-194] He noted that
the President was blue-white or ashen in color; had slow, spasmodic,
agonal respiration without any coordination; made no voluntary
movements; had his eyes open with the pupils dilated without any
reaction to light; evidenced no palpable pulse; and had a few chest
sounds which were thought to be heart beats.[C2-195] On the basis of
these findings, Dr. Carrico concluded that President Kennedy was still
alive.[C2-196]

Dr. Carrico noted two wounds: a small bullet wound in the front
lower neck, and an extensive wound in the President’s head where
a sizable portion of the skull was missing.[C2-197] He observed
shredded brain tissue and “considerable slow oozing” from the latter
wound, followed by “more profuse bleeding” after some circulation
was established.[C2-198] Dr. Carrico felt the President’s back and
determined that there was no large wound there which would be an
immediate threat to life.[C2-199] Observing the serious problems
presented by the head wound and inadequate respiration, Dr. Carrico
directed his attention to improving the President’s breathing.[C2-200]
He noted contusions, hematoma to the right of the larynx, which was
deviated slightly to the left, and also ragged tissue which indicated
a tracheal injury.[C2-201] Dr. Carrico inserted a cuffed endotracheal
tube past the injury, inflated the cuff, and connected it to a Bennett
machine to assist in respiration.[C2-202]

At that point, direction of the President’s treatment was undertaken by
Dr. Malcolm O. Perry, who arrived at trauma room 1 a few moments after
the President.[C2-203] Dr. Perry noted the President’s back brace as
he felt for a femoral pulse, which he did not find.[C2-204] Observing
that an effective airway had to be established if treatment was to be
effective, Dr. Perry performed a tracheotomy, which required 3 to 5
minutes.[C2-205] While Dr. Perry was performing the tracheotomy, Drs.
Carrico and Ronald Jones made cutdowns on the President’s right leg and
left arm, respectively, to infuse blood and fluids into the circulatory
system.[C2-206] Dr. Carrico treated the President’s known adrenal
insufficiency by administering hydrocortisone.[C2-207] Dr. Robert
N. McClelland entered at that point and assisted Dr. Perry with the
tracheotomy.[C2-208]

Dr. Fouad Bashour, chief of cardiology, Dr. M. T. Jenkins, chief
of anesthesiology, and Dr. A. H. Giesecke, Jr., then joined in the
effort to revive the President.[C2-209] When Dr. Perry noted free air
and blood in the President’s chest cavity, he asked that chest tubes
be inserted to allow for drainage of blood and air. Drs. Paul C.
Peters and Charles R. Baxter initiated these procedures.[C2-210] As a
result of the infusion of liquids through the cutdowns, the cardiac
massage, and the airway, the doctors were able to maintain peripheral
circulation as monitored at the neck (carotid) artery and at the wrist
(radial) pulse. A femoral pulse was also detected in the President’s
leg.[C2-211] While these medical efforts were in progress, Dr. Clark
noted some electrical activity on the cardiotachyscope attached to
monitor the President’s heart responses.[C2-212] Dr. Clark, who most
closely observed the head wound, described a large, gaping wound in the
right rear part of the head, with substantial damage and exposure of
brain tissue, and a considerable loss of blood.[C2-213] Dr. Clark did
not see any other hole or wound on the President’s head. According to
Dr. Clark, the small bullet hole on the right rear of the President’s
head discovered during the subsequent autopsy “could have easily been
hidden in the blood and hair.”[C2-214]

In the absence of any neurological, muscular, or heart response,
the doctors concluded that efforts to revive the President were
hopeless.[C2-215] This was verified by Admiral Burkley, the President’s
physician, who arrived at the hospital after emergency treatment
was underway and concluded that “my direct services to him at that
moment would have interfered with the action of the team which was
in progress.”[C2-216] At approximately 1 p.m., after last rites were
administered to the President by Father Oscar L. Huber, Dr. Clark
pronounced the President dead. He made the official determination
because the ultimate cause of death, the severe head injury, was within
his sphere of specialization.[C2-217] The time was fixed at 1 p.m.,
as an approximation, since it was impossible to determine the precise
moment when life left the President.[C2-218] President Kennedy could
have survived the neck injury, but the head wound was fatal.[C2-219]
From a medical viewpoint, President Kennedy was alive when he arrived
at Parkland Hospital; the doctors observed that he had a heart beat
and was making some respiratory efforts.[C2-220] But his condition was
hopeless, and the extraordinary efforts of the doctors to save him
could not help but to have been unavailing.

Since the Dallas doctors directed all their efforts to controlling the
massive bleeding caused by the head wound, and to reconstructing an
airway to his lungs, the President remained on his back throughout his
medical treatment at Parkland.[C2-221] When asked why he did not turn
the President over, Dr. Carrico testified as follows:

    A. This man was in obvious extreme distress and any more
    thorough inspection would have involved several minutes--well,
    several--considerable time which at this juncture was not
    available. A thorough inspection would have involved washing
    and cleansing the back, and this is not practical in treating
    an acutely injured patient. You have to determine which things,
    which are immediately life threatening and cope with them,
    before attempting to evaluate the full extent of the injuries.

    Q. Did you ever have occasion to look at the President’s back?

    A. No, sir. Before--well, in trying to treat an acutely injured
    patient, you have to establish an airway, adequate ventilation
    and you have to establish adequate circulation. Before this was
    accomplished the President’s cardiac activity had ceased and
    closed cardiac massage was instituted, which made it impossible
    to inspect his back.

    Q. Was any effort made to inspect the President’s back after he
    had expired?

    A. No, sir.

    Q. And why was no effort made at that time to inspect his back?


    A. I suppose nobody really had the heart to do it.[C2-222]

Moreover, the Parkland doctors took no further action after the
President had expired because they concluded that it was beyond the
scope of their permissible duties.[C2-223]


Treatment of Governor Connally

While one medical team tried to revive President Kennedy, a second
performed a series of operations on the bullet wounds sustained by
Governor Connally.[C2-224] Governor Connally was originally seen by Dr.
Carrico and Dr. Richard Dulany.[C2-225] While Dr. Carrico went on to
attend the President, Dr. Dulany stayed with the Governor and was soon
joined by several other doctors.[C2-226] At approximately 12:45 p.m.,
Dr. Robert Shaw, chief of thoracic surgery, arrived at trauma room 2,
to take charge of the care of Governor Connally, whose major wound fell
within Dr. Shaw’s area of specialization.[C2-227]

Governor Connally had a large sucking wound in the front of the right
chest which caused extreme pain and difficulty in breathing. Rubber
tubes were inserted between the second and third ribs to reexpand the
right lung, which had collapsed because of the opening in the chest
wall.[C2-228] At 1:35 p.m., after Governor Connally had been moved to
the operating room, Dr. Shaw started the first operation by cutting
away the edges of the wound on the front of the Governor’s chest and
suturing the damaged lung and lacerated muscles.[C2-229] The elliptical
wound in the Governor’s back, located slightly to the left of the
Governor’s right armpit approximately five-eighths inch (a centimeter
and a half) in its greatest diameter, was treated by cutting away
the damaged skin and suturing the back muscle and skin.[C2-230] This
operation was concluded at 3:20 p.m.[C2-231]

Two additional operations were performed on Governor Connally for
wounds which he had not realized he had sustained until he regained
consciousness the following day.[C2-232] From approximately 4 p.m. to
4:50 p.m. on November 22, Dr. Charles F. Gregory, chief of orthopedic
surgery, operated on the wounds of Governor Connally’s right wrist,
assisted by Drs. William Osborne and John Parker.[C2-233] The wound on
the back of the wrist was left partially open for draining, and the
wound on the palm side was enlarged, cleansed, and closed. The fracture
was set, and a cast was applied with some traction utilized.[C2-234]
While the second operation was in progress, Dr. George T. Shires,
assisted by Drs. Robert McClelland, Charles Baxter, and Ralph Don
Patman, treated the gunshot wound in the left thigh.[C2-235] This
punctuate missile wound, about two-fifths inch in diameter (1
centimeter) and located approximately 5 inches above the left knee,
was cleansed and closed with sutures; but a small metallic fragment
remained in the Governor’s leg.[C2-236]


Vice President Johnson at Parkland

As President Kennedy and Governor Connally were being removed from the
limousine onto stretchers, a protective circle of Secret Service agents
surrounded Vice President and Mrs. Johnson and escorted them into
Parkland Hospital through the emergency entrance.[C2-237] The agents
moved a nurse and patient out of a nearby room, lowered the shades, and
took emergency security measures to protect the Vice President.[C2-238]
Two men from the President’s followup car were detailed to help
protect the Vice President. An agent was stationed at the entrance
to stop anyone who was not a member of the Presidential party. U.S.
Representatives Henry B. Gonzalez, Jack Brooks, Homer Thornberry, and
Albert Thomas joined Clifton C. Carter and the group of special agents
protecting the Vice President.[C2-239] On one occasion Mrs. Johnson,
accompanied by two Secret Service agents, left the room to see Mrs.
Kennedy and Mrs. Connally.[C2-240]

Concern that the Vice President might also be a target for
assassination prompted the Secret Service agents to urge him to
leave the hospital and return to Washington immediately.[C2-241] The
Vice President decided to wait until he received definitive word of
the President’s condition.[C2-242] At approximately 1:20 p.m., Vice
President Johnson was notified by O’Donnell that President Kennedy was
dead.[C2-243] Special Agent Youngblood learned from Mrs. Johnson the
location of her two daughters and made arrangements through Secret
Service headquarters in Washington to provide them with protection
immediately.[C2-244]

When consulted by the Vice President, O’Donnell advised him to go to
the airfield immediately and return to Washington.[C2-245] It was
decided that the Vice President should return on the Presidential
plane rather than on the Vice-Presidential plane because it had better
communication equipment.[C2-246] The Vice President conferred with
White House Assistant Press Secretary Malcolm Kilduff and decided
that there would be no release of the news of the President’s death
until the Vice President had left the hospital.[C2-247] When told that
Mrs. Kennedy refused to leave without the President’s body, the Vice
President said that he would not leave Dallas without her.[C2-248] On
the recommendation of the Secret Service agents, Vice President Johnson
decided to board the Presidential airplane, _Air Force One_, and wait
for Mrs. Kennedy and the President’s body.[C2-249]


Secret Service Emergency Security Arrangements

Immediately after President Kennedy’s stretcher was wheeled into trauma
room 1, Secret Service agents took positions at the door of the small
emergency room. A nurse was asked to identify hospital personnel and
to tell everyone, except necessary medical staff members, to leave the
emergency room. Other Secret Service agents posted themselves in the
corridors and other areas near the emergency room. Special Agent Lawson
made certain that the Dallas police kept the public and press away
from the immediate area of the hospital.[C2-250] Agents Kellerman and
Hill telephoned the head of the White House detail, Gerald A. Behn, to
advise him of the assassination. The telephone line to Washington was
kept open throughout the remainder of the stay at the hospital.[C2-251]

Secret Service agents stationed at later stops on the President’s
itinerary of November 22 were redeployed. Men at the Trade Mart were
driven to Parkland Hospital in Dallas police cars.[C2-252] The Secret
Service group awaiting the President in Austin were instructed to
return to Washington.[C2-253] Meanwhile, the Secret Service agents
in charge of security at Love Field started to make arrangements for
departure. As soon as one of the agents learned of the shooting, he
asked the officer in charge of the police detail at the airport to
institute strict security measures for the Presidential aircraft, the
airport terminal, and the surrounding area. The police were cautioned
to prevent picture taking. Secret Service agents working with police
cleared the areas adjacent to the aircraft, including warehouses,
other terminal buildings and the neighboring parking lots, of all
people.[C2-254] The agents decided not to shift the Presidential
aircraft to the far side of the airport because the original landing
area was secure and a move would require new measures.[C2-255]

When security arrangements at the airport were complete, the Secret
Service made the necessary arrangements for the Vice President to leave
the hospital. Unmarked police cars took the Vice President and Mrs.
Johnson from Parkland Hospital to Love Field. Chief Curry drove one
automobile occupied by Vice President Johnson, U.S. Representatives
Thomas and Thornberry, and Special Agent Youngblood. In another car
Mrs. Johnson was driven to the airport accompanied by Secret Service
agents and Representative Brooks. Motorcycle policemen who escorted the
automobiles were requested by the Vice President and Agent Youngblood
not to use sirens. During the drive Vice President Johnson, at
Youngblood’s instruction, kept below window level.[C2-256]


Removal of the President’s Body

While the team of doctors at Parkland Hospital tried desperately to
save the life of President Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy alternated between
watching them and waiting outside.[C2-257] After the President was
pronounced dead, O’Donnell tried to persuade Mrs. Kennedy to leave the
area, but she refused. She said that she intended to stay with her
husband.[C2-258] A casket was obtained and the President’s body was
prepared for removal.[C2-259] Before the body could be taken from the
hospital, two Dallas officials informed members of the President’s
staff that the body could not be removed from the city until an autopsy
was performed. Despite the protests of these officials, the casket was
wheeled out of the hospital, placed in an ambulance, and transported to
the airport shortly after 2 p.m.[C2-260] At approximately 2:15 p.m. the
casket was loaded, with some difficulty because of the narrow airplane
door, onto the rear of the Presidential plane where seats had been
removed to make room.[C2-261] Concerned that the local officials might
try to prevent the plane’s departure, O’Donnell asked that the pilot
take off immediately. He was informed that takeoff would be delayed
until Vice President Johnson was sworn in.[C2-262]


THE END OF THE TRIP

Swearing in of the New President

From the Presidential airplane, the Vice President telephoned Attorney
General Robert F. Kennedy, who advised that Mr. Johnson take the
Presidential oath of office before the plane left Dallas.[C2-263]
Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes hastened to the plane to administer the
oath.[C2-264] Members of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential parties
filled the central compartment of the plane to witness the swearing in.
At 2:38 p.m., c.s.t., Lyndon Baines Johnson took the oath of office as
the 36th President of the United States.[C2-265] Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs.
Johnson stood at the side of the new President as he took the oath of
office.[C2-266] Nine minutes later, the Presidential airplane departed
for Washington, D.C.[C2-267]


Return to Washington, D.C.

On the return flight, Mrs. Kennedy sat with David Powers, Kenneth
O’Donnell, and Lawrence O’Brien.[C2-268] At 5:58 p.m., e.s.t.,
_Air Force One_ landed at Andrews AFB, where President Kennedy had
begun his last trip only 31 hours before.[C2-269] Detailed security
arrangements had been made by radio from the President’s plane on the
return flight.[C2-270] The public had been excluded from the base,
and only Government officials and the press were permitted near the
landing area. Upon arrival, President Johnson made a brief statement
over television and radio. President and Mrs. Johnson were flown by
helicopter to the White House, from where Mrs. Johnson was driven to
her residence under Secret Service escort. The President then walked to
the Executive Office Building, where he worked until 9 p.m.[C2-271]


The Autopsy

Given a choice between the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda,
Md., and the Army’s Walter Reed Hospital, Mrs. Kennedy chose the
hospital in Bethesda for the autopsy because the President had served
in the Navy.[C2-272] Mrs. Kennedy and the Attorney General, with three
Secret Service agents, accompanied President Kennedy’s body on the
45-minute automobile trip from Andrews AFB to the Hospital.[C2-273] On
the 17th floor of the Hospital, Mrs. Kennedy and the Attorney General
joined other members of the Kennedy family to await the conclusion of
the autopsy.[C2-274] Mrs. Kennedy was guarded by Secret Service agents
in quarters assigned to her in the naval hospital.[C2-275] The Secret
Service established a communication system with the White House and
screened all telephone calls and visitors.[C2-276]

The hospital received the President’s body for autopsy at approximately
7:35 p.m.[C2-277] X-rays and photographs were taken preliminarily
and the pathological examination began at about 8 p.m.[C2-278] The
autopsy report noted that President Kennedy was 46 years of age, 72½
inches tall, weighed 170 pounds, had blue eyes and reddish-brown
hair. The body was muscular and well developed with no gross skeletal
abnormalities except for those caused by the gunshot wounds. Under
“Pathological Diagnosis” the cause of death was set forth as “Gunshot
wound, head.”[C2-279] (See app. IX.)

The autopsy examination revealed two wounds in the President’s head.
One wound, approximately one-fourth of an inch by five-eighths of an
inch (6 by 15 millimeters), was located about an inch (2.5 centimeters)
to the right and slightly above the large bony protrusion (external
occipital protuberance) which juts out at the center of the lower part
of the back of the skull. The second head wound measured approximately
5 inches (13 centimeters) in its greatest diameter, but it was
difficult to measure accurately because multiple crisscross fractures
radiated from the large defect.[C2-280] During the autopsy examination,
Federal agents brought the surgeons three pieces of bone recovered from
Elm Street and the Presidential automobile. When put together, these
fragments accounted for approximately three-quarters of the missing
portion of the skull.[C2-281] The surgeons observed, through X-ray
analysis, 30 or 40 tiny dustlike fragments of metal running in a line
from the wound in the rear of the President’s head toward the front
part of the skull, with a sizable metal fragment lying just above the
right eye.[C2-282] From this head wound two small irregularly shaped
fragments of metal were recovered and turned over to the FBI.[C2-283]

The autopsy also disclosed a wound near the base of the back of
President Kennedy’s neck slightly to the right of his spine. The
doctors traced the course of the bullet through the body and, as
information was received from Parkland Hospital, concluded that the
bullet had emerged from the front portion of the President’s neck that
had been cut away by the tracheotomy at Parkland.[C2-284] The nature
and characteristics of this neck wound and the two head wounds are
discussed fully in the next chapter.

After the autopsy was concluded at approximately 11 p.m., the
President’s body was prepared for burial. This was finished at
approximately 4 a.m.[C2-285] Shortly thereafter, the President’s wife,
family and aides left Bethesda Naval Hospital.[C2-286] The President’s
body was taken to the East Room of the White House where it was placed
under ceremonial military guard.




CHAPTER III

The Shots From the Texas School Book Depository


In this chapter the Commission analyzes the evidence and sets forth
its conclusions concerning the source, effect, number and timing
of the shots that killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor
Connally. In that connection the Commission has evaluated (1) the
testimony of eyewitnesses present at the scene of the assassination;
(2) the damage to the Presidential limousine; (3) the examination by
qualified experts of the rifle and cartridge cases found on the sixth
floor of the Texas School Book Depository and the bullet fragments
found in the Presidential limousine and at Parkland Hospital; (4)
the wounds suffered by President Kennedy and Governor Connally; (5)
wound ballistics tests; (6) the examination by qualified experts of
the clothing worn by President Kennedy and Governor Connally; and (7)
motion-picture films and still photographs taken at the time of the
assassination.


THE WITNESSES

As reflected in the previous chapter, passengers in the first few cars
of the motorcade had the impression that the shots came from the rear
and from the right, the general direction of the Texas School Book
Depository Building, although none of these passengers saw anyone
fire the shots. Some spectators at Houston and Elm Streets, however,
did see a rifle being fired in the direction of the President’s car
from the easternmost window of the sixth floor on the south side of
the building. Other witnesses saw a rifle in this window immediately
after the assassination. Three employees of the Depository, observing
the parade from the fifth floor, heard the shots fired from the floor
immediately above them. No credible evidence suggests that the shots
were fired from the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass, the
nearby railroad yards or any place other than the Texas School Book
Depository Building.

[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 477

Position of Howard L. Brennan on November 22, 1963. (Photograph taken
on March 20, 1964, and marked by Brennan during his testimony to show
the window (A) in which he saw a man with a rifle, and the window (B)
on the fifth floor in which he saw people watching the motorcade.)]


Near the Depository

Eyewitnesses testified that they saw a man fire a weapon from the
sixth-floor window. Howard L. Brennan, a 45-year-old steamfitter,
watched the motorcade from a concrete retaining wall at the southwest
corner of Elm and Houston, where he had a clear view of the south side
of the Depository Building.[C3-1] (See Commission Exhibit No. 477, p.
62.) He was approximately 107 feet from the Depository entrance and
120 feet from the southeast corner window of the sixth floor.[C3-2]
Brennan’s presence and vantage point are corroborated by a motion
picture of the motorcade taken by amateur photographer Abraham
Zapruder, which shows Brennan, wearing gray khaki work clothes and a
gray work helmet, seated on the retaining wall.[C3-3] Brennan later
identified himself in the Zapruder movie.[C3-4] While waiting about
7 minutes for the President to arrive, he observed the crowd on the
street and the people at the windows of the Depository Building.[C3-5]
He noticed a man at the southeast corner window of the sixth floor, and
observed him leave the window “a couple of times.”[C3-6]

Brennan watched the President’s car as it turned the corner at Houston
and Elm and moved down the incline toward the Triple Underpass. Soon
after the President’s car passed, he heard an explosion like the
backfire of a motorcycle.[C3-7] Brennan recalled:

    Well, then something, just right after this explosion, made me
    think that it was a firecracker being thrown from the Texas
    Book Store. And I glanced up. And this man that I saw previous
    was aiming for his last shot.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Well, as it appeared to me he was standing up and resting
    against the left window sill, with gun shouldered to his
    right shoulder, holding the gun with his left hand and taking
    positive aim and fired his last shot. As I calculate a couple
    of seconds. He drew the gun back from the window as though he
    was drawing it back to his side and maybe paused for another
    second as though to assure hisself that he hit his mark, and
    then he disappeared.[C3-8]

Brennan stated that he saw 70 to 85 percent of the gun when it was
fired and the body of the man from the waist up.[C3-9] The rifle was
aimed southwesterly down Elm Street toward the underpass.[C3-10]
Brennan saw the man fire one shot and he remembered hearing a total
of only two shots. When questioned about the number of shots, Brennan
testified:

    I don’t know what made me think that there was firecrackers
    throwed out of the Book Store unless I did hear the second
    shot, because I positively thought the first shot was a
    backfire, and subconsciously I must have heard a second shot,
    but I do not recall it. I could not swear to it.[C3-11]

Brennan quickly reported his observations to police officers.[C3-12]
Brennan’s description of the man he saw is discussed in the next
chapter.

Amos Lee Euins, a 15-year-old ninth grade student, stated that he was
facing the Depository as the motorcade turned the corner at Elm and
Houston. He recalled:

    Then I was standing here, and as the motorcade turned the
    corner, I was facing, looking dead at the building. And so I
    seen this pipe thing sticking out the window. I wasn’t paying
    too much attention to it. Then when the first shot was fired, I
    started looking around, thinking it was a backfire. Everybody
    else started looking around. Then I looked up at the window,
    and he shot again.[C3-13]

After witnessing the first shots, Euins hid behind a fountain bench
and saw the man shoot again from the window in the southeast corner of
the Depository’s sixth floor.[C3-14] According to Euins, the man had
one hand on the barrel and the other on the trigger. Euins believed
that there were four shots.[C3-15] Immediately after the assassination,
he reported his observations to Sgt. D. V. Harkness of the Dallas
Police Department and also to James Underwood of station KRLD-TV of
Dallas.[C3-16] Sergeant Harkness testified that Euins told him that
the shots came from the last window of the floor “under the ledge”
on the side of the building they were facing.[C3-17] Based on Euins’
statements, Harkness radioed to headquarters at 12:36 p.m. that “I have
a witness that says that it came from the fifth floor of the Texas Book
Depository Store.”[C3-18] Euins accurately described the sixth floor as
the floor “under the ledge.” Harkness testified that the error in the
radio message was due to his own “hasty count of the floors.”[C3-19]

Other witnesses saw a rifle in the window after the shots were fired.
Robert H. Jackson, staff photographer, Dallas Times Herald, was in a
press car in the Presidential motorcade, eight or nine cars from the
front. On Houston Street about halfway between Main and Elm, Jackson
heard the first shot.[C3-20] As someone in the car commented that it
sounded like a firecracker, Jackson heard two more shots.[C3-21] He
testified:

    Then we realized or we thought that it was gunfire, and then we
    could not at that point see the President’s car. We were still
    moving slowly, and after the third shot the second two shots
    seemed much closer together than the first shot, than they were
    to the first shot. Then after the last shot, I guess all of
    us were just looking all around and I just looked straight up
    ahead of me which would have been looking at the School Book
    Depository and I noticed two Negro men in a window straining to
    see directly above them, and my eyes followed right on up to
    the window above them and I saw the rifle or what looked like
    a rifle approximately half of the weapon, I guess I saw, and
    just as I looked at it, it was drawn fairly slowly back into
    the building, and I saw no one in the window with it.

    I didn’t even see a form in the window.[C3-22]

In the car with Jackson were James Underwood, television station
KRLD-TV; Thomas Dillard, chief photographer, Dallas Morning News;
Malcolm O. Couch and James Darnell, television newsreel cameramen.
Dillard, Underwood, and the driver were in the front seat, Couch
and Darnell were sitting on top of the back seat of the convertible
with Jackson. Dillard, Couch, and Underwood confirmed that Jackson
spontaneously exclaimed that he saw a rifle in the window.[C3-23]
According to Dillard, at the time the shots were fired he and his
fellow passengers “had an absolutely perfect view of the School
Depository from our position in the open car.”[C3-24] Dillard
immediately took two pictures of the building: one of the east
two-thirds of the south side and the other of the southeast corner,
particularly the fifth- and sixth-floor windows.[C3-25] These pictures
show three Negro men in windows on the fifth floor and the partially
open window on the sixth floor directly above them. (See Dillard
Exhibits C and D, pp. 66-67.) Couch also saw the rifle in the window,
and testified:

    And after the third shot, Bob Jackson, who was, as I recall,
    on my right, yelled something like, “Look up in the window!
    There’s the rifle!”

    And I remember glancing up to a window on the far right, which
    at the time impressed me as the sixth or seventh floor, and
    seeing about a foot of a rifle being--the barrel brought into
    the window.[C3-26]

Couch testified he saw people standing in other windows on the third
or fourth floor in the middle of the south side, one of them being a
Negro in a white T-shirt leaning out to look up at the windows above
him.[C3-27]

Mayor and Mrs. Earle Cabell rode in the motorcade immediately behind
the Vice-Presidential followup car.[C3-28] Mrs. Cabell was seated in
the back seat behind the driver and was facing U.S. Representative
Ray Roberts on her right as the car made the turn at Elm and Houston.
In this position Mrs. Cabell “was actually facing” the seven-story
Depository when the first shot rang out.[C3-29] She “jerked” her head
up immediately and saw a “projection” in the first group of windows
on a floor which she described both as the sixth floor and the top
floor.[C3-30] According to Mrs. Cabell, the object was “rather long
looking,” but she was unable to determine whether it was a mechanical
object or a person’s arm.[C3-31] She turned away from the window to
tell her husband that the noise was a shot, and “just as I got the
words out * * * the second two shots rang out.”[C3-32] Mrs. Cabell did
not look at the sixth-floor window when the second and third shots were
fired.[C3-33]

James N. Crawford and Mary Ann Mitchell, two deputy district clerks for
Dallas County, watched the motorcade at the southeast corner of Elm and
Houston. After the President’s car turned the corner, Crawford heard
a loud report which he thought was backfire coming from the direction
of the Triple Underpass.[C3-34] He heard a second shot seconds later,
followed quickly by a third. At the third shot, he looked up and saw a
“movement” in the far east corner of the sixth floor of the Depository,
the only open window on that floor.[C3-35] He told Miss Mitchell “that
if those were shots they came from that window.” When asked to describe
the movement more exactly, he said,

    * * * I would say that it was a profile, somewhat from
    the waist up, but it was a very quick movement and rather
    indistinct and it was very light colored. * * *

       *       *       *       *       *

    When I saw it, I automatically in my mind came to the
    conclusion that it was a person having moved out of the window.
    * * *[C3-36]

He could not state whether the person was a man or a woman.[C3-37] Miss
Mitchell confirmed that after the third shot Crawford told her, “Those
shots came from that building.”[C3-38] She saw Crawford pointing at a
window but was not sure at which window he was pointing.[C3-39]


On the Fifth Floor

Three Depository employees shown in the picture taken by Dillard were
on the fifth floor of the building when the shots were fired: James
Jarman, Jr., age 34, a wrapper in the shipping department; Bonnie Ray
Williams, age 20, a warehouseman temporarily assigned to laying a
plywood floor on the sixth floor; and Harold Norman, age 26, an “order
filler.” Norman and Jarman decided to watch the parade during the lunch
hour from the fifth-floor windows.[C3-40] From the ground floor they
took the west elevator, which operates with push-button controls, to
the fifth floor.[C3-41] Meanwhile, Williams had gone up to the sixth
floor where he had been working and ate his lunch on the south side of
that floor. Since he saw no one around when he finished his lunch, he
started down on the east elevator, looking for company. He left behind
his paper lunch sack, chicken bones and an empty pop bottle.[C3-42]
Williams went down to the fifth floor, where he joined Norman and
Jarman at approximately 12:20 pm.[C3-43]

Harold Norman was in the fifth-floor window in the southeast corner,
directly under the window where witnesses saw the rifle. (See
Commission Exhibit No. 485, p. 69.) He could see light through the
ceiling cracks between the fifth and sixth floors.[C3-44] As the
motorcade went by, Norman thought that the President was saluting with
his right arm,

[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 485 Positions occupied by
Depository employees on fifth floor on November 22, 1963.]

    * * * and I can’t remember what the exact time was but I know I
    heard a shot, and then after I heard the shot, well, it seems
    as though the President, you know, slumped or something, and
    then another shot and I believe Jarman or someone told me,
    he said, “I believe someone is shooting at the President,”
    and I think I made a statement “It is someone shooting at the
    President, and I believe it came from up above us.”

    Well, I couldn’t see at all during the time but I know I heard
    a third shot fired, and I could also hear something sounded
    like the shell hulls hitting the floor and the ejecting of the
    rifle * * *.[C3-45]

Williams said that he “really did not pay any attention” to the first
shot--

    * * * because I did not know what was happening. The second
    shot, it sounded like it was right in the building, the second
    and third shot. And it sounded--it even shook the building, the
    side we were on. Cement fell on my head.

    Q. You say cement fell on your head?

    A. Cement, gravel, dirt, or something, from the old building,
    because it shook the windows and everything. Harold was sitting
    next to me, and he said it came right from over our head.[C3-46]

Williams testified Norman said “I can even hear the shell being ejected
from the gun hitting the floor.”[C3-47]

When Jarman heard the first sound, he thought that it was either a
backfire--

    * * * or an officer giving a salute to the President. And then
    at that time I didn’t, you know, think too much about it. * * *

       *       *       *       *       *

    Well, after the third shot was fired, I think I got up and
    I run over to Harold Norman and Bonnie Ray Williams, and
    told them, I said, I told them that it wasn’t a backfire or
    anything, that somebody was shooting at the President.[C3-48]

Jarman testified that Norman said “that he thought the shots had come
from above us, and I noticed that Bonnie Ray had a few debris in his
head. It was sort of white stuff, or something.”[C3-49] Jarman stated
that Norman said “that he was sure that the shot came from inside the
building because he had been used to guns and all that, and he said
it didn’t sound like it was too far off anyway.”[C3-50] The three men
ran to the west side of the building, where they could look toward the
Triple Underpass to see what had happened to the motorcade.[C3-51]

After the men had gone to the window on the west side of the building,
Jarman “got to thinking about all the debris on Bonnie Ray’s head” and
said, “That shot probably did come from upstairs, up over us.”[C3-52]
He testified that Norman said, “I know it did, because I could hear
the action of the bolt, and I could hear the cartridges drop on the
floor.”[C3-53] After pausing for a few minutes, the three men ran
downstairs. Norman and Jarman ran out of the front entrance of the
building, where they saw Brennan, the construction worker who had seen
the man in the window firing the gun, talking to a police officer, and
they then reported their own experience.[C3-54]

On March 20, 1964, preceding their appearance before the Commission,
these witnesses were interviewed in Dallas. At that time members of the
Commission’s legal staff conducted an experiment. Norman, Williams,
and Jarman placed themselves at the windows of the fifth floor as they
had been on November 22. A Secret Service agent operated the bolt of
a rifle directly above them at the southeast corner window of the
sixth floor. At the same time, three cartridge shells were dropped to
the floor at intervals of about 3 seconds. According to Norman, the
noise outside was less on the day of the assassination than on the day
of the test.[C3-55] He testified, “Well, I heard the same sound, the
sound similar. I heard three something that he dropped on the floor and
then I could hear the rifle or whatever he had up there.”[C3-56] The
experiment with the shells and rifle was repeated for members of the
Commission on May 9, 1964, on June 7, 1964, and again on September 6,
1964. All seven of the Commissioners clearly heard the shells drop to
the floor.


At the Triple Underpass

In contrast to the testimony of the witnesses who heard and observed
shots fired from the Depository, the Commission’s investigation has
disclosed no credible evidence that any shots were fired from anywhere
else. When the shots were fired, many people near the Depository
believed that the shots came from the railroad bridge over the Triple
Underpass or from the area to the west of the Depository.[C3-57] In
the hectic moments after the assassination, many spectators ran in
the general direction of the Triple Underpass or the railroad yards
northwest of the building. Some were running toward the place from
which the sound of the rifle fire appeared to come, others were fleeing
the scene of the shooting.[C3-58] None of these people saw anyone with
a rifle, and the Commission’s inquiry has yielded no evidence that
shots were fired from the bridge over the Triple Underpass or from the
railroad yards.

On the day of the motorcade, Patrolman J. W. Foster stood on the east
side of the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass and Patrolman
J. C. White stood on the west side.[C3-59] Patrolman Joe E. Murphy
was standing over Elm Street on the Stemmons Freeway overpass, west
of the railroad bridge farther away from the Depository.[C3-60] Two
other officers were stationed on Stemmons Freeway to control traffic
as the motorcade entered the Freeway.[C3-61] Under the advance
preparations worked out between the Secret Service and the Dallas
Police Department, the policemen were under instructions to keep
“unauthorized” people away from these locations.[C3-62] When the
motorcade reached the intersection of Elm and Houston Streets, there
were no spectators on Stemmons Freeway where Patrolman Murphy was
stationed.[C3-63] Patrolman Foster estimated that there were 10 or 11
people on the railroad bridge where he was assigned;[C3-64] another
witness testified that there were between 14 and 18 people there as the
motorcade came into view.[C3-65] Investigation has disclosed 15 persons
who were on the railroad bridge at this time, including 2 policemen,
2 employees of the Texas-Louisiana Freight Bureau and 11 employees of
the Union Terminal Co.[C3-66] In the absence of any explicit definition
of “unauthorized” persons, the policemen permitted these employees to
remain on the railroad bridge to watch the motorcade. (See chapter
VIII, pp. 446-447.) At the request of the policemen, S.M. Holland,
signal supervisor for Union Terminal Co., came to the railroad bridge
at about 11:45 a.m. and remained to identify those persons who were
railroad employees.[C3-67] In addition, Patrolman Foster checked
credentials to determine if persons seeking access to the bridge were
railroad employees.[C3-68] Persons who were not railroad employees were
ordered away, including one news photographer who wished only to take a
picture of the motorcade.[C3-69]

Another employee of the Union Terminal Co., Lee E. Bowers, Jr., was at
work in a railroad tower about 14 feet above the tracks to the north
of the railroad bridge and northwest of the corner of Elm and Houston,
approximately 50 yards from the back of the Depository.[C3-70] (See
Commission Exhibit No. 2218, p. 73.) From the tower he could view
people moving in the railroad yards and at the rear of the Depository.
According to Bowers, “Since approximately 10 o’clock in the morning
traffic had been cut off into the area so that anyone moving around
could actually be observed.”[C3-71] During the 20 minutes prior to
the arrival of the motorcade, Bowers noticed three automobiles which
entered his immediate area; two left without discharging any passengers
and the third was apparently on its way out when last observed by
Bowers.[C3-72] Bowers observed only three or four people in the general
area, as well as a few bystanders on the railroad bridge over the
Triple Underpass.[C3-73]

As the motorcade proceeded toward the Triple Underpass, the spectators
were clustered together along the east concrete wall of the railroad
bridge facing the oncoming procession.[C3-74] (See Commission Exhibit
No. 2215, p. 75.) Patrolman Foster stood immediately behind them and
could observe all of them.[C3-75] Secret Service agents in the lead car
of the motorcade observed the bystanders and the police officer on the
bridge.[C3-76] Special Agent Winston G. Lawson motioned through the
windshield in an unsuccessful attempt to instruct Patrolman Foster to
move the people away from their position directly over the path of the
motorcade.[C3-77] Some distance away, on the Stemmons Freeway overpass
above Elm Street, Patrolman Murphy also had the group on the railroad
bridge within view.[C3-78] When he heard the shots, Foster rushed to
the wall of the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass and looked
toward the street.[C3-79] After the third shot, Foster ran toward the
Depository and shortly thereafter informed Inspector Herbert J. Sawyer
of the Dallas Police Department that he thought the shots came from the
vicinity of Elm and Houston.[C3-80]

(BETWEEN ZAPRUDER FRAMES 272-280)]

Other witnesses on the railroad bridge had varying views concerning
the source and number of the shots. Austin L. Miller, employed by the
Texas-Louisiana Freight Bureau, heard three shots and thought that they
came from the area of the Presidential limousine itself.[C3-81] One of
his coworkers, Royce G. Skelton, thought he heard four shots, but could
not tell their exact source.[C3-82] Frank E. Reilly, an electrician
at Union Terminal, heard three shots which seemed to come from the
trees “On the north side of Elm Street at the corner up there.”[C3-83]
According to S.M. Holland, there were four shots which sounded as
though they came from the trees on the north side of Elm Street where
he saw a puff of smoke.[C3-84] Thomas J. Murphy, a mail foreman at
Union Terminal Co., heard two shots and said that they came from a
spot just west of the Depository.[C3-85] In the railroad tower, Bowers
heard three shots, which sounded as though they came either from the
Depository Building or near the mouth of the Triple Underpass. Prior
to November 22, 1963, Bowers had noted the similarity of the sounds
coming from the vicinity of the Depository and those from the Triple
Underpass, which he attributed to “a reverberation which takes place
from either location.”[C3-86]

Immediately after the shots were fired, neither the policemen nor
the spectators on the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass saw
anything suspicious on the bridge in their vicinity. (See Commission
Exhibit No. 2214, p. 74.) No one saw anyone with a rifle. As he ran
around through the railroad yards to the Depository, Patrolman Foster
saw no suspicious activity.[C3-87] The same was true of the other
bystanders, many of whom made an effort after the shooting to observe
any unusual activity. Holland, for example, immediately after the
shots, ran off the overpass to see if there was anyone behind the
picket fence on the north side of Elm Street, but he did not see anyone
among the parked cars.[C3-88] Miller did not see anyone running across
the railroad tracks or on the plaza west of the Depository.[C3-89]
Bowers and others saw a motorcycle officer dismount hurriedly and
come running up the incline on the north side of Elm Street.[C3-90]
The motorcycle officer, Clyde A. Haygood, saw no one running from the
railroad yards.[C3-91]


THE PRESIDENTIAL AUTOMOBILE

After the Presidential car was returned to Washington on November 22,
1963, Secret Service agents found two bullet fragments in the front
seat. One fragment, found on the seat beside the driver, weighed 44.6
grains and consisted of the nose portion of a bullet.[C3-92] The
other fragment, found along the right side of the front seat, weighed
21.0 grains and consisted of the base portion of a bullet.[C3-93]
During the course of an examination on November 23, agents of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation found three small lead particles,
weighing between seven-tenths and nine-tenths of a grain each, on the
rug underneath the left jump seat which had been occupied by Mrs.
Connally.[C3-94] During this examination, the Bureau agents noted a
small residue of lead on the inside surface of the laminated windshield
and a very small pattern of cracks on the outer layer of the windshield
immediately behind the lead residue.[C3-95] There was a minute particle
of glass missing from the outside surface, but no penetration. The
inside layer of glass was not broken.[C3-96] The agents also observed a
dent in the strip of chrome across the top of the windshield, located
to the left of the rear view mirror support.[C3-97]

The lead residue on the inside of the windshield was compared under
spectrographic analysis by FBI experts with the bullet fragments
found on and alongside the front seat and with the fragments under
the left jump seat. It was also compared with bullet fragments found
at Parkland Hospital. All these bullet fragments were found to be
similar in metallic composition, but it was not possible to determine
whether two or more of the fragments came from the same bullet.[C3-98]
It is possible for the fragments from the front seat to have been a
part of the same bullet as the three fragments found near the left
jump seat,[C3-99] since a whole bullet of this type weighs 160-161
grains.[C3-100] (See app. X, pp. 555-558.)

The physical characteristics of the windshield after the assassination
demonstrate that the windshield was struck on the inside surface. The
windshield is composed of two layers of glass with a very thin layer
of plastic in the middle “which bonds them together in the form of
safety glass.”[C3-101] The windshield was extracted from the automobile
and was examined during a Commission hearing.[C3-102] (See Commission
Exhibit No. 350, p. 78.) According to Robert A. Frazier, FBI firearms
expert, the fact that cracks were present on the outer layer of glass
showed that the glass had been struck from the inside. He testified
that the windshield

    could not have been struck on the outside surface because of
    the manner in which the glass broke and further because of the
    lead residue on the inside surface. The cracks appear in the
    outer layer of the glass because the glass is bent outward at
    the time of impact which stretches the outer layer of the glass
    to the point where these small radial or wagon spoke, wagon
    wheel spoke-type cracks appear on the outer surface.[C3-103]

Although there is some uncertainty whether the dent in the chrome on
the windshield was present prior to the assassination,[C3-104] Frazier
testified that the dent “had been caused by some projectile which
struck the chrome on the inside surface.”[C3-105] If it was caused
by a shot during the assassination, Frazier stated that it would not
have been caused by a bullet traveling at full velocity, but rather
by a fragment traveling at “fairly high velocity.”[C3-106] It could
have been caused by either fragment found in the front seat of the
limousine.[C3-107]

EXPERT EXAMINATION OF RIFLE, CARTRIDGE CASES, AND BULLET FRAGMENTS

On the sixth floor of the Depository Building, the Dallas police
found three spent cartridges and a rifle. A nearly whole bullet was
discovered on the stretcher used to carry Governor Connally at Parkland
Hospital. As described in the preceding section, five bullet fragments
were found in the President’s limousine. The cartridge cases, the
nearly whole bullet and the bullet fragments were all subjected to
firearms identification analysis by qualified experts. It was the
unanimous opinion of the experts that the nearly whole bullet, the two
largest bullet fragments and the three cartridge cases were definitely
fired in the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building
to the exclusion of all other weapons.


Discovery of Cartridge Cases and Rifle

Shortly after the assassination, police officers arrived at the
Depository Building and began a search for the assassin and
evidence.[C3-108] Around 1 p.m. Deputy Sheriff Luke Mooney noticed a
pile of cartons in front of the window in the southeast corner of the
sixth floor.[C3-109] (See Commission Exhibit No. 723, p. 80.) Searching
that area he found at approximately 1:12 p.m. three empty cartridge
cases on the floor near the window.[C3-110] When he was notified of
Mooney’s discovery, Capt. J. W. Fritz, chief of the homicide bureau of
the Dallas Police Department, issued instructions that nothing be moved
or touched until technicians from the police crime laboratory could
take photographs and check for fingerprints.[C3-111] Mooney stood guard
to see that nothing was disturbed.[C3-112] A few minutes later, Lt.
J. C. Day of the Dallas Police Department arrived and took photographs
of the cartridge cases before anything had been moved.[C3-113]

At 1:22 p.m. Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone and Deputy Constable Seymour
Weitzman found a bolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight between two
rows of boxes in the northwest corner near the staircase on the sixth
floor.[C3-114] No one touched the weapon or otherwise disturbed the
scene until Captain Fritz and Lieutenant Day arrived and the weapon
was photographed as it lay on the floor.[C3-115] After Lieutenant Day
determined that there were no fingerprints on the knob of the bolt and
that the wooden stock was too rough to take fingerprints, he picked the
rifle up by the stock and held it that way while Captain Fritz opened
the bolt and ejected a live round.[C3-116] Lieutenant Day retained
possession of the weapon and took it back to the police department
for examination.[C3-117] Neither Boone nor Weitzman handled the
rifle.[C3-118]


Discovery of Bullet at Parkland Hospital

A nearly whole bullet was found on Governor Connally’s stretcher
at Parkland Hospital after the assassination. After his arrival at
the hospital the Governor was brought into trauma room No. 2 on a
stretcher, removed from the room on that stretcher a short time later,
and taken on an elevator to the second-floor operating room.[C3-119] On
the second floor he was transferred from the stretcher to an operating
table which was then moved into the operating room, and a hospital
attendant wheeled the empty stretcher into an elevator.[C3-120] Shortly
afterward, Darrell C. Tomlinson, the hospital’s senior engineer,
removed this stretcher from the elevator and placed it in the corridor
on the ground floor, alongside another stretcher wholly unconnected
with the care of Governor Connally.[C3-121] A few minutes later, he
bumped one of the stretchers against the wall and a bullet rolled
out.[C3-122]

[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 723

Shield of cartons around sixth floor southeast corner window.]

Although Tomlinson was not certain whether the bullet came from the
Connally stretcher or the adjacent one, the Commission has concluded
that the bullet came from the Governor’s stretcher. That conclusion is
buttressed by evidence which eliminated President Kennedy’s stretcher
as a source of the bullet. President Kennedy remained on the stretcher
on which he was carried into the hospital while the doctors tried to
save his life.[C3-123] He was never removed from the stretcher from the
time he was taken into the emergency room until his body was placed
in a casket in that same room.[C3-124] After the President’s body
was removed from that stretcher, the linen was taken off and placed
in a hamper and the stretcher was pushed into trauma room No. 2, a
completely different location from the site where the nearly whole
bullet was found.[C3-125]


Description of Rifle

The bolt-action, clip-fed rifle found on the sixth floor of the
Depository, described more fully in appendix X, is inscribed with
various markings, including “MADE ITALY,” “CAL. 6.5,” “1940” and the
number C2766.[C3-126] (See Commission Exhibit Nos. 1303, 541(2) and
541(3), pp. 82-83.) These markings have been explained as follows:
“MADE ITALY” refers to its origin; “CAL. 6.5” refers to the rifle’s
caliber; “1940” refers to the year of manufacture; and the number
C2766 is the serial number. This rifle is the only one of its type
bearing that serial number.[C3-127] After review of standard reference
works and the markings on the rifle, it was identified by the FBI as a
6.5-millimeter model 91/38 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.[C3-128] Experts
from the FBI made an independent determination of the caliber by
inserting a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter cartridge into the weapon
for fit, and by making a sulfur cast of the inside of the weapon’s
barrel and measuring the cast with a micrometer.[C3-129] From outward
appearance, the weapon would appear to be a 7.35-millimeter rifle, but
its mechanism had been rebarreled with a 6.5-millimeter barrel.[C3-130]
Constable Deputy Sheriff Weitzman, who only saw the rifle at a glance
and did not handle it, thought the weapon looked like a 7.65 Mauser
bolt-action rifle.[C3-131] (See chapter V, p. 235.)

The rifle is 40.2 inches long and weighs 8 pounds.[C3-132] The
minimum length broken down is 34.8 inches, the length of the wooden
stock.[C3-133] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, p. 132.) Attached
to the weapon is an inexpensive four-power telescopic sight,
stamped “Optics Ordnance Inc./Hollywood California,” and “Made in
Japan.”[C3-134] The weapon also bears a sling consisting of two leather
straps. The sling is not a standard rifle sling but appears to be a
musical instrument strap or a sling from a carrying case or camera
bag.[C3-135]

Expert Testimony

Four experts in the field of firearms identification analyzed the
nearly whole bullet, the two largest fragments and the three cartridge
cases to determine whether they had been fired from the C2766
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository.
Two of these experts testified before the Commission. One was Robert A.
Frazier, a special agent of the FBI assigned to the FBI Laboratory in
Washington, D.C. Frazier has worked generally in the field of firearms
identification for 23 years, examining firearms of various types for
the purpose of identifying the caliber and other characteristics of the
weapons and making comparisons of bullets and cartridge cases for the
purpose of determining whether or not they were fired in a particular
weapon.[C3-136] He estimated that he has made “in the neighborhood of
50,000 to 60,000” firearms comparisons and has testified in court on
about 400 occasions.[C3-137] The second witness who testified on this
subject was Joseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the bureau of criminal
identification and investigation for the State of Illinois. Nicol
also has had long and substantial experience since 1941 in firearms
identification, and estimated that he has made thousands of bullet and
cartridge case examinations.[C3-138]

In examining the bullet fragments and cartridge cases, these experts
applied the general principles accepted in the field of firearms
identification, which are discussed in more detail in appendix X at
pages 547-553. In brief, a determination that a particular bullet or
cartridge case has been fired in a particular weapon is based upon a
comparison of the bullet or case under examination with one or more
bullets or cases known to have been fired in that weapon. When a bullet
is fired in any given weapon, it is engraved with the characteristics
of the weapon. In addition to the rifling characteristics of the
barrel which are common to all weapons of a given make and model,
every weapon bears distinctive microscopic markings on its barrel,
firing pin and bolt face.[C3-139] These markings arise initially
during manufacture, since the action of the manufacturing tools
differs microscopically from weapon to weapon and since, in addition,
the tools change microscopically while being used. As a weapon is
used further distinctive markings are introduced. Under microscopic
examination a qualified expert may be able to determine whether the
markings on a bullet known to have been fired in a particular weapon
and the markings on a suspect bullet are the same and, therefore,
whether both bullets were fired in the same weapon to the exclusion
of all other weapons. Similarly, firearms identification experts are
able to compare the markings left upon the base of cartridge cases and
thereby determine whether both cartridges were fired by the same weapon
to the exclusion of all other weapons. According to Frazier, such
an identification “is made on the presence of sufficient individual
microscopic characteristics so that a very definite pattern is formed
and visualized on the two surfaces.”[C3-140] Under some circumstances,
as where the bullet or cartridge case is seriously mutilated, there are
not sufficient individual characteristics to enable the expert to make
a firm identification.[C3-141]

After making independent examinations, both Frazier and Nicol
positively identified the nearly whole bullet from the stretcher and
the two larger bullet fragments found in the Presidential limousine as
having been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the
Depository to the exclusion of all other weapons.[C3-142] Each of the
two bullet fragments had sufficient unmutilated area to provide the
basis for an identification.[C3-143] However, it was not possible to
determine whether the two bullet fragments were from the same bullet
or from two different bullets.[C3-144] With regard to the other bullet
fragments discovered in the limousine and in the course of treating
President Kennedy and Governor Connally, however, expert examination
could demonstrate only that the fragments were “similar in metallic
composition” to each other, to the two larger fragments and to the
nearly whole bullet.[C3-145] After examination of the three cartridge
cases found on the sixth floor of the Depository, Frazier and Nicol
concluded that they had been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle to the exclusion of all other weapons.[C3-146] Two other experts
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who made independent
examinations of the nearly whole bullet, bullet fragments and cartridge
cases, reached the identical conclusions.[C3-147]


THE BULLET WOUNDS

In considering the question of the source of the shots fired at
President Kennedy and Governor Connally, the Commission has also
evaluated the expert medical testimony of the doctors who observed
the wounds during the emergency treatment at Parkland Hospital and
during the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital. It paid particular
attention to any wound characteristics which would be of assistance
in identifying a wound as the entrance or exit point of a missile.
Additional information regarding the source and nature of the injuries
was obtained by expert examination of the clothes worn by the two men,
particularly those worn by President Kennedy, and from the results of
special wound ballistics tests conducted at the Commission’s request,
using the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle with ammunition of the same
type as that used and found on November 22, 1963.


The President’s Head Wounds

The detailed autopsy of President Kennedy performed on the night of
November 22 at the Bethesda Naval Hospital led the three examining
pathologists to conclude that the smaller hole in the rear of the
President’s skull was the point of entry and that the large opening on
the right side of his head was the wound of exit.[C3-148] The smaller
hole on the back of the President’s head measured one-fourth of an
inch by five-eighths of an inch (6 by 15 millimeters).[C3-149] The
dimensions of that wound were consistent with having been caused by
a 6.5-millimeter bullet fired from behind and above which struck at
a tangent or an angle causing a 15-millimeter cut. The cut reflected
a larger dimension of entry than the bullet’s diameter of 6.5
millimeters, since the missile, in effect, sliced along the skull for
a fractional distance until it entered.[C3-150] The dimension of 6
millimeters, somewhat smaller than the diameter of a 6.5-millimeter
bullet, was caused by the elastic recoil of the skull which shrinks the
size of an opening after a missile passes through it.[C3-151]

Lt. Col. Pierre A. Finck, Chief of the Wound Ballistics Pathology
Branch of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, who has
had extensive experience with bullet wounds, illustrated the
characteristics which led to his conclusions about the head wound by
a chart prepared by him. This chart, based on Colonel Finck’s studies
of more than 400 cases, depicted the effect of a perforating missile
wound on the human skull.[C3-152] When a bullet enters the skull
(cranial vault) at one point and exits at another, it causes a beveling
or cratering effect where the diameter of the hole is smaller on the
impact side than on the exit side. Based on his observations of that
beveling effect on the President’s skull, Colonel Finck testified:
“President Kennedy was, in my opinion, shot from the rear. The bullet
entered in the back of the head and went out on the right side of his
skull * * * he was shot from above and behind.”[C3-153]

Comdr. James J. Humes, senior pathologist and director of laboratories
at the Bethesda Naval Hospital, who acted as chief autopsy surgeon,
concurred in Colonel Finck’s analysis. He compared the beveling or
coning effect to that caused by a BB shot which strikes a pane of
glass, causing a round or oval defect on the side of the glass where
the missile strikes and a belled-out or coned-out surface on the
opposite side of the glass.[C3-154] Referring to the bullet hole on the
back of President Kennedy’s head, Commander Humes testified: “The wound
on the inner table, however, was larger and had what in the field of
wound ballistics is described as a shelving or coning effect.”[C3-155]
After studying the other hole in the President’s skull, Commander Humes
stated: “* * * we concluded that the large defect to the upper right
side of the skull, in fact, would represent a wound of exit.”[C3-156]
Those characteristics led Commander Humes and Comdr. J. Thornton
Boswell, chief of pathology at Bethesda Naval Hospital, who assisted
in the autopsy, to conclude that the bullet penetrated the rear of the
President’s head and exited through a large wound on the right side of
his head.[C3-157]

Ballistics experiments (discussed more fully in app. X, pp. 585-586)
showed that the rifle and bullets identified above were capable of
producing the President’s head wound. The Wound Ballistics Branch of
the U.S. Army laboratories at Edgewood Arsenal, Md., conducted an
extensive series of experiments to test the effect of Western Cartridge
Co. 6.5-millimeter bullets, the type found on Governor Connally’s
stretcher and in the Presidential limousine, fired from the C2766
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the Depository. The Edgewood Arsenal
tests were performed under the immediate supervision of Alfred G.
Olivier, a doctor who had spent 7 years in wounds ballistics research
for the U.S. Army.[C3-158]

One series of tests, performed on reconstructed inert human skulls,
demonstrated that the President’s head wound could have been caused
by the rifle and bullets fired by the assassin from the sixth-floor
window. The results of this series were illustrated by the findings on
one skull which was struck at a point closely approximating the wound
of entry on President Kennedy’s head. That bullet blew out the right
side of the reconstructed skull in a manner very similar to the head
wound of the President.[C3-159] As a result of these tests, Dr. Olivier
concluded that a Western Cartridge Co. 6.5 bullet fired from the C2766
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle at a distance of 90 yards would make the same
type of wound as that found on the President’s head. Referring to the
series of tests, Dr. Olivier testified:

    It disclosed that the type of head wounds that the President
    received could be done by this type of bullet. This surprised
    me very much, because this type of stable bullet I didn’t
    think would cause a massive head wound, I thought it would go
    through making a small entrance and exit, but the bones of the
    skull are enough to deform the end of this bullet causing it to
    expend a lot of energy and blowing out the side of the skull or
    blowing out fragments of the skull.[C3-160]

After examining the fragments of the bullet which struck the
reconstructed skull, Dr. Olivier stated that--

    the recovered fragments were very similar to the ones recovered
    on the front seat and on the floor of the car.

    This, to me, indicates that those fragments did come from the
    bullet that wounded the President in the head.[C3-161]


The President’s Neck Wounds

During the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital another bullet wound
was observed near the base of the back of President Kennedy’s neck
slightly to the right of his spine which provides further enlightenment
as to the source of the shots. The hole was located approximately 5½
inches (14 centimeters) from the tip of the right shoulder joint and
approximately the same distance below the tip of the right mastoid
process, the bony point immediately behind the ear.[C3-162] The
wound was approximately one-fourth by one-seventh of an inch (7 by
4 millimeters), had clean edges, was sharply delineated, and had
margins similar in all respects to those of the entry wound in the
skull.[C3-163] Commanders Humes and Boswell agreed with Colonel Finck’s
testimony that this hole--

    * * * is a wound of entrance. * * * The basis for that
    conclusion is that this wound was relatively small with clean
    edges. It was not a jagged wound, and that is what we see in
    wound of entrance at a long range.[C3-164]

The autopsy examination further disclosed that, after entering the
President, the bullet passed between two large muscles, produced a
contusion on the upper part of the pleural cavity (without penetrating
that cavity), bruised the top portion of the right lung and ripped the
windpipe (trachea) in its path through the President’s neck.[C3-165]
The examining surgeons concluded that the wounds were caused by the
bullet rather than the tracheotomy performed at Parkland Hospital.
The nature of the bruises indicated that the President’s heart and
lungs were functioning when the bruises were caused, whereas there
was very little circulation in the President’s body when incisions
on the President’s chest were made to insert tubes during the
tracheotomy.[C3-166] No bone was struck by the bullet which passed
through the President’s body.[C3-167] By projecting from a point of
entry on the rear of the neck and proceeding at a slight downward angle
through the bruised interior portions, the doctors concluded that the
bullet exited from the front portion of the President’s neck that had
been cut away by the tracheotomy.[C3-168]

Concluding that a bullet passed through the President’s neck, the
doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital rejected a theory that the bullet
lodged in the large muscles in the back of his neck and fell out
through the point of entry when external heart massage was applied at
Parkland Hospital. In the earlier stages of the autopsy, the surgeons
were unable to find a path into any large muscle in the back of the
neck. At that time they did not know that there had been a bullet
hole in the front of the President’s neck when he arrived at Parkland
Hospital because the tracheotomy incision had completely eliminated
that evidence.[C3-169] While the autopsy was being performed, surgeons
learned that a whole bullet had been found at Parkland Hospital on
a stretcher which, at that time, was thought to be the stretcher
occupied by the President. This led to speculation that the bullet
might have penetrated a short distance into the back of the neck and
then dropped out onto the stretcher as a result of the external heart
massage.[C3-170]

Further exploration during the autopsy disproved that theory. The
surgeons determined that the bullet had passed between two large strap
muscles and bruised them without leaving any channel, since the bullet
merely passed between them.[C3-171] Commander Humes, who believed
that a tracheotomy had been performed from his observations at the
autopsy, talked by telephone with Dr. Perry early on the morning of
November 23, and learned that his assumption was correct and that Dr.
Perry had used the missile wound in the neck as the point to make the
incision.[C3-172] This confirmed the Bethesda surgeons’ conclusion that
the bullet had exited from the front part of the neck.

The findings of the doctors who conducted the autopsy were consistent
with the observations of the doctors who treated the President at
Parkland Hospital. Dr. Charles S. Carrico, a resident surgeon at
Parkland, noted a small wound approximately one-fourth of an inch in
diameter (5 to 8 millimeters) in the lower third of the neck below
the Adam’s apple.[C3-173] Dr. Malcolm O. Perry, who performed the
tracheotomy, described the wound as approximately one-fifth of an inch
in diameter (5 millimeters) and exuding blood which partially hid edges
that were “neither cleancut, that is, punched out, nor were they very
ragged.”[C3-174] Dr. Carrico testified as follows:

    Q. Based on your observations on the neck wound alone did you
    have a sufficient basis to form an opinion as to whether it was
    an entrance or an exit wound?

    A. No, sir; we did not. Not having completely evaluated all
    the wounds, traced out the course of the bullets, this wound
    would have been compatible with either entrance or exit wound
    depending upon the size, the velocity, the tissue structure and
    so forth.[C3-175]

The same response was made by Dr. Perry to a similar query:

    Q. Based on the appearance of the neck wound alone, could it
    have been either an entrance or an exit wound?

    A. It could have been either.[C3-176]

Then each doctor was asked to take into account the other known facts,
such as the autopsy findings, the approximate distance the bullet
traveled and tested muzzle velocity of the assassination weapon. With
these additional factors, the doctors commented on the wound on the
front of the President’s neck as follows:

    Dr. CARRICO. With those facts and the fact as I understand it
    no other bullet was found this would be, this was, I believe,
    was an exit wound.[C3-177]

    Dr. PERRY. A full jacketed bullet without deformation passing
    through skin would leave a similar wound for an exit and
    entrance wound and with the facts which you have made available
    and with these assumptions, I believe that it was an exit
    wound.[C3-178]

Other doctors at Parkland Hospital who observed the wound prior to
the tracheotomy agreed with the observations of Drs. Perry and
Carrico.[C3-179] The bullet wound in the neck could be seen for only
a short time, since Dr. Perry eliminated evidence of it when he
performed the tracheotomy. He selected that spot since it was the point
where such an operation was customarily performed, and it was one
of the safest and easiest spots from which to reach the trachea. In
addition, there was possibly an underlying wound to the muscles in the
neck, the carotid artery or the jugular vein, and Dr. Perry concluded
that the incision, therefore, had to be low in order to maintain
respiration.[C3-180]

Considerable confusion has arisen because of comments attributed to
Dr. Perry concerning the nature of the neck wound. Immediately after
the assassination, many people reached erroneous conclusions about the
source of the shots because of Dr. Perry’s observations to the press.
On the afternoon of November 22, a press conference was organized
at Parkland Hospital by members of the White House press staff and
a hospital administrator. Newsmen with microphones and cameras were
crowded into a room to hear statements by Drs. Perry and William
Kemp Clark, chief neurosurgeon at Parkland, who had attended to
President Kennedy’s head injury. Dr. Perry described the situation as
“bedlam.”[C3-181] The confusion was compounded by the fact that some
questions were only partially answered before other questions were
asked.[C3-182]

At the news conference, Dr. Perry answered a series of hypothetical
questions and stated to the press that a variety of possibilities
could account for the President’s wounds. He stated that a single
bullet could have caused the President’s wounds by entering through
the throat, striking the spine, and being deflected upward with the
point of exit being through the head.[C3-183] This would have accounted
for the two wounds he observed, the hole in the front of the neck and
the large opening in the skull. At that time, Dr. Perry did not know
about either the wound on the back of the President’s neck or the small
bullet-hole wound in the back of the head. As described in chapter
II, the President was lying on his back during his entire time at
Parkland. The small hole in the head was also hidden from view by the
large quantity of blood which covered the President’s head. Dr. Perry
said his answers at the press conference were intended to convey his
theory about what could have happened, based on his limited knowledge
at the time, rather than his professional opinion about what did
happen.[C3-184] Commenting on his answers at the press conference, Dr.
Perry testified before the Commission:

    I expressed it [his answers] as a matter of speculation that
    this was conceivable. But, again, Dr. Clark [who also answered
    questions at the conference] and I emphasized that we had no
    way of knowing.[C3-185]

Dr. Perry’s recollection of his comments is corroborated by some of the
news stories after the press conference. The New York Herald Tribune on
November 23, 1963, reported as follows:

     Dr. Malcolm Perry, 34, attendant surgeon at Parkland Hospital
    who attended the President, said he saw two wounds--one below
    the Adam’s apple, the other at the back of the head. He said he
    did not know if two bullets were involved. It is possible, he
    said, that the neck wound was the entrance and the other the
    exit of the missile.[C3-186]

According to this report, Dr. Perry stated merely that it was
“possible” that the neck wound was a wound of entrance. This conforms
with his testimony before the Commission, where he stated that by
themselves the characteristics of the neck wound were consistent with
being either a point of entry or exit.

_Wound ballistics tests._--Experiments performed by the Army Wound
Ballistics experts at Edgewood Arsenal, Md. (discussed in app. X, p.
582) showed that under simulated conditions entry and exit wounds are
very similar in appearance. After reviewing the path of the bullet
through the President’s neck, as disclosed in the autopsy report,
the experts simulated the neck by using comparable material with a
thickness of approximately 5½ inches (13½ to 14½ centimeters), which
was the distance traversed by the bullet. Animal skin was placed on
each side, and Western Cartridge Co. 6.5 bullets were fired from the
C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle from a distance of 180 feet. The animal
skin on the entry side showed holes which were regular and round.
On the exit side two holes were only slightly elongated, indicating
that the bullet had become only a little unstable at the point of
exit.[C3-187] A third exit hole was round, although not quite as
regular as the entry holes.[C3-188] The exit holes, especially the
one most nearly round, appeared similar to the descriptions given by
Drs. Perry and Carrico of the hole in the front of the President’s
neck.[C3-189]

The autopsy disclosed that the bullet which entered the back of the
President’s neck hit no bony structure and proceeded in a slightly
downward angle. The markings on the President’s clothing indicate
that the bullet moved in a slight right to left lateral direction as
it passed through the President’s body.[C3-190] After the examining
doctors expressed the thought that a bullet would have lost very
little velocity in passing through the soft tissue of the neck, wound
ballistics experts conducted tests to measure the exit velocity of
the bullet.[C3-191] The tests were the same as those used to create
entry and exit holes, supplemented by the use of break-type screens
which measured the velocity of bullets. The entrance velocity of the
bullet fired from the rifle averaged 1,904 feet per second after it
traveled 180 feet. The exit velocity averaged 1,772 to 1,798 feet per
second, depending upon the substance through which the bullet passed.
A photograph of the path of the bullet traveling through the simulated
neck showed that it proceeded in a straight line and was stable.[C3-192]

_Examination of clothing._--The clothing worn by President Kennedy on
November 22 had holes and tears which showed that a missile entered
the back of his clothing in the vicinity of his lower neck and exited
through the front of his shirt immediately behind his tie, nicking the
knot of his tie in its forward flight.[C3-193] Although the caliber
of the bullet could not be determined and some of the clothing items
precluded a positive determination that some tears were made by a
bullet, all the defects could have been caused by a 6.5-millimeter
bullet entering the back of the President’s lower neck and exiting in
the area of the knot of his tie.[C3-194]

An examination of the suit jacket worn by the President by FBI Agent
Frazier revealed a roughly circular hole approximately one-fourth of
an inch in diameter on the rear of the coat, 5⅜ inches below the top
of the collar and 1¾ inches to the right of the center back seam of
the coat.[C3-195] The hole was visible on the upper rear of the coat
slightly to the right of center. Traces of copper were found in the
margins of the hole and the cloth fibers around the margins were pushed
inward.[C3-196] Those characteristics established that the hole was
caused by an entering bullet.[C3-197] Although the precise size of the
bullet could not be determined from the hole, it was consistent with
having been made by a 6.5-millimeter bullet.[C3-198]

The shirt worn by the President contained a hole on the back side 5¾
inches below the top of the collar and 1⅛ inches to the right of the
middle of the back of the shirt.[C3-199] The hole on the rear of the
shirt was approximately circular in shape and about one-fourth of an
inch in diameter, with the fibers pressed inward.[C3-200] These factors
established it as a bullet entrance hole.[C3-201] The relative position
of the hole in the back of the suit jacket to the hole in the back
of the shirt indicated that both were caused by the same penetrating
missile.[C3-202]

On the front of the shirt, examination revealed a hole seven-eighths
of an inch below the collar button and a similar opening seven-eighths
of an inch below the buttonhole. These two holes fell into alinement
on overlapping positions when the shirt was buttoned.[C3-203] Each
hole was a vertical, ragged slit approximately one-half of an inch
in height, with the cloth fibers protruding outward. Although the
characteristics of the slit established that the missile had exited
to the front, the irregular nature of the slit precluded a positive
determination that it was a bullet hole.[C3-204] However, the hole
could have been caused by a round bullet although the characteristics
were not sufficiently clear to enable the examining expert to render a
conclusive opinion.[C3-205]

When the President’s clothing was removed at Parkland Hospital, his tie
was cut off by severing the loop immediately to the wearer’s left of
the knot, leaving the knot in its original condition.[C3-206] The tie
had a nick on the left side of the knot.[C3-207] The nick was elongated
horizontally, indicating that the tear was made by some object moving
horizontally, but the fibers were not affected in a manner which would
shed light on the direction or the nature of the missile.[C3-208]


The Governor’s Wounds

While riding in the right jump seat of the Presidential limousine
on November 22, Governor Connally sustained wounds of the back,
chest, right wrist and left thigh. Because of the small size and
clean-cut edges of the wound on the Governor’s back, Dr. Robert Shaw
concluded that it was an entry wound.[C3-209] The bullet traversed
the Governor’s chest in a downward angle, shattering his fifth rib,
and exited below the right nipple.[C3-210] The ragged edges of the
2-inch (5 centimeters) opening on the front of the chest led Dr. Shaw
to conclude that it was the exit point of the bullet.[C3-211] When
Governor Connally testified before the Commission 5 months after
the assassination, on April 21, 1964, the Commission observed the
Governor’s chest wounds, as well as the injuries to his wrist and thigh
and watched Dr. Shaw measure with a caliper an angle of declination of
25° from the point of entry on the back to the point of exit on the
front of the Governor’s chest.[C3-212]

At the time of the shooting, Governor Connally was unaware that he had
sustained any injuries other than his chest wounds.[C3-213] On the back
of his arm, about 2 inches (5 centimeters) above the wrist joint on
the thumb side, Dr. Charles F. Gregory observed a linear perforating
wound approximately one-fifth of an inch (one-half centimeter) wide
and 1 inch (2½ centimeters) long.[C3-214] During his operation on this
injury, the doctor concluded that this ragged wound was the point of
entry because thread and cloth had been carried into the wound to the
region of the bone.[C3-215] Dr. Gregory’s conclusions were also based
upon the location in the Governor’s wrist, as revealed by X-ray, of
small fragments of metal shed by the missile upon striking the firm
surface of the bone.[C3-216] Evidence of different amounts of air in
the tissues of the wrist gave further indication that the bullet passed
from the back to the front of the wrist.[C3-217] An examination of the
palm surface of the wrist showed a wound approximately one-fifth of
an inch (one-half centimeter) long and approximately three-fourths of
an inch (2 centimeters) above the crease of the right wrist.[C3-218]
Dr. Shaw had initially believed that the missile entered on the palm
side of the Governor’s wrist and exited on the back side.[C3-219]
After reviewing the factors considered by Dr. Gregory, however, Dr.
Shaw withdrew his earlier opinion. He deferred to the judgment of Dr.
Gregory, who had more closely examined that wound during the wrist
operation.[C3-220]

In addition, Governor Connally suffered a puncture wound in the left
thigh that was approximately two-fifths of an inch (1 centimeter) in
diameter and located approximately 5 or 6 inches above the Governor’s
left knee.[C3-221] On the Governor’s leg, very little soft-tissue
damage was noted, which indicated a tangential wound or the penetration
of a larger missile entering at low velocity and stopping after
entering the skin.[C3-222] X-ray examination disclosed a tiny metallic
fragment embedded in the Governor’s leg.[C3-223] The surgeons who
attended the Governor concluded that the thigh wound was not caused
by the small fragment in the thigh but resulted from the impact of a
larger missile.[C3-224]

_Examination of clothing._--The clothing worn by Governor Connally
on November 22, 1963, contained holes which matched his wounds. On
the back of the Governor’s coat, a hole was found 1⅛ inches from
the seam where the right sleeve attached to the coat and 7¼ inches
to the right of the midline.[C3-225] This hole was elongated in a
horizontal direction approximately five-eighths of an inch in length
and one-fourth of an inch in height.[C3-226] The front side of the
Governor’s coat contained a circular hole three-eighths of an inch in
diameter, located 5 inches to the right of the front right edge of the
coat slightly above the top button.[C3-227] A rough hole approximately
five-eighths of an inch in length and three-eighths of an inch in width
was found near the end of the right sleeve.[C3-228] Each of these holes
could have been caused by a bullet, but a positive determination of
this fact or the direction of the missile was not possible because the
garment had been cleaned and pressed prior to any opportunity for a
scientific examination.[C3-229]

An examination of the Governor’s shirt disclosed a very ragged tear
five-eighths of an inch long horizontally and one-half of an inch
vertically on the back of the shirt near the right sleeve 2 inches
from the line where the sleeve attaches.[C3-230] Immediately to the
right was another small tear, approximately three-sixteenths of an inch
long.[C3-231] The two holes corresponded in position to the hole in
the back of the Governor’s coat.[C3-232] A very irregular tear in the
form of an “H” was observed on the front side of the Governor’s shirt,
approximately 1½ inches high, with a crossbar tear approximately 1 inch
wide, located 5 inches from the right side seam and 9 inches from the
top of the right sleeve.[C3-233] Because the shirt had been laundered,
there were insufficient characteristics for the expert examiner to form
a conclusive opinion on the direction or nature of the object causing
the holes.[C3-234] The rear hole could have been caused by the entrance
of a 6.5-millimeter bullet and the front hole by the exit of such a
bullet.[C3-235]

On the French cuff of the right sleeve of the Governor’s shirt was
a ragged, irregularly shaped hole located 1½ inches from the end of
the sleeve and 5½ inches from the outside cuff-link hole.[C3-236] The
characteristics after laundering did not permit positive conclusions
but these holes could have been caused by a bullet passing through the
Governor’s right wrist from the back to the front sides.[C3-237] The
Governor’s trousers contained a hole approximately one-fourth of an
inch in diameter in the region of the left knee.[C3-238] The roughly
circular shape of the hole and the slight tearing away from the edges
gave the hole the general appearance of a bullet hole but it was not
possible to determine the direction of the missile which caused the
hole.[C3-239]

_Course of bullet._--Ballistics experiments and medical findings
established that the missile which passed through the Governor’s wrist
and penetrated his thigh had first traversed his chest. The Army Wound
Ballistics experts conducted tests which proved that the Governor’s
wrist wound was not caused by a pristine bullet. (See app. X, pp.
582-585.) A bullet is pristine immediately on exiting from a rifle
muzzle when it moves in a straight line with a spinning motion and
maintains its uniform trajectory with but a minimum of nose surface
striking the air through which it passes.[C3-240] When the straight
line of flight of a bullet is deflected by striking some object, it
starts to wobble or become irregular in flight, a condition called
yaw.[C3-241] A bullet with yaw has a greater surface exposed to the
striking material or air, since the target or air is struck not only
by the nose of the bullet, its smallest striking surface, but also by
the bullet’s sides.[C3-242]

The ballistics experts learned the exact nature of the Governor’s wrist
wound by examining Parkland Hospital records and X-rays and conferring
with Dr. Gregory. The C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the
Depository was fired with bullets of the same type as the bullet found
on the Governor’s stretcher and the fragments found in the Presidential
limousine. Shots were fired from a distance of 70 yards at comparable
flesh and bone protected by material similar to the clothing worn by
the Governor.[C3-243] One of the test shots wounded the comparable
flesh and bone structure in virtually the same place and from the same
angle as the wound inflicted on Governor Connally’s wrist. An X-ray and
photograph of the simulated wrist confirmed the similarity.[C3-244] The
bullet which inflicted that injury during the tests had a nose which
was substantially flattened from striking the material.[C3-245] The
striking velocity at 70 yards of seven shots fired during the tests
averaged 1,858 feet per second; the average exit velocity of five shots
was 1,776 feet per second.[C3-246]

The conclusion that the Governor’s wrist was not struck by a pristine
bullet was based upon the following: (1) greater damage was inflicted
on the test material than on the Governor’s wrist;[C3-247] (2) the
test material had a smaller entry wound and a larger exit wound,
characteristic of a pristine bullet, while the Governor’s wrist had
a larger entry wound as compared with its exit wound, indicating a
bullet which was tumbling;[C3-248] (3) cloth was carried into the
wrist wound, which is characteristic of an irregular missile;[C3-249]
(4) the partial cutting of a radial nerve and tendon leading to the
Governor’s thumb further suggested that the bullet which struck him was
not pristine, since such a bullet would merely push aside a tendon and
nerve rather than catch and tear them;[C3-250] (5) the bullet found
on the Governor’s stretcher probably did not pass through the wrist
as a pristine bullet because its nose was not considerably flattened,
as was the case with the pristine bullet which struck the simulated
wrist;[C3-251] and (6) the bullet which caused the Governor’s thigh
injury and then fell out of the wound had a “very low velocity,”
whereas the pristine bullets fired during the tests possessed a very
high exit velocity.[C3-252]

All the evidence indicated that the bullet found on the Governor’s
stretcher could have caused all his wounds. The weight of the whole
bullet prior to firing was approximately 160-161 grains and that of the
recovered bullet was 158.6 grains.[C3-253] An X-ray of the Governor’s
wrist showed very minute metallic fragments, and two or three of these
fragments were removed from his wrist.[C3-254] All these fragments were
sufficiently small and light so that the nearly whole bullet found on
the stretcher could have deposited those pieces of metal as it tumbled
through his wrist.[C3-255] In their testimony, the three doctors who
attended Governor Connally at Parkland Hospital expressed independently
their opinion that a single bullet had passed through his chest;
tumbled through his wrist with very little exit velocity, leaving small
metallic fragments from the rear portion of the bullet; punctured his
left thigh after the bullet had lost virtually all of its velocity; and
had fallen out of the thigh wound.[C3-256]

Governor Connally himself thought it likely that all his wounds were
caused by a single bullet. In his testimony before the Commission, he
repositioned himself as he recalled his position on the jump seat, with
his right palm on his left thigh, and said:

    I * * * wound up the next day realizing I was hit in three
    places, and I was not conscious of having been hit but by one
    bullet, so I tried to reconstruct how I could have been hit
    in three places by the same bullet, and I merely, I know it
    penetrated from the back through the chest first.

    I assumed that I had turned as I described a moment ago,
    placing my right hand on my left leg, that it hit my wrist,
    went out the center of the wrist, the underside, and then into
    my leg, but it might not have happened that way at all.[C3-257]

The Governor’s posture explained how a single missile through his
body would cause all his wounds. His doctors at Parkland Hospital had
recreated his position, also, but they placed his right arm somewhat
higher than his left thigh although in the same alinement.[C3-258] The
wound ballistics experts concurred in the opinion that a single bullet
caused all the Governor’s wounds.[C3-259]


THE TRAJECTORY

The cumulative evidence of eyewitnesses, firearms and ballistic
experts and medical authorities demonstrated that the shots were
fired from above and behind President Kennedy and Governor Connally,
more particularly, from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book
Depository Building. In order to determine the facts with as much
precision as possible and to insure that all data were consistent
with the shots having been fired from the sixth floor window, the
Commission requested additional investigation, including the analysis
of motion picture films of the assassination and onsite tests. The
facts developed through this investigation by the FBI and Secret
Service confirmed the conclusions reached by the Commission regarding
the source and trajectory of the shots which hit the President and the
Governor. Moreover, these facts enabled the Commission to make certain
approximations regarding the locations of the Presidential limousine at
the time of the shots and the relevant time intervals.


Films and Tests

When the shots rang out the Presidential limousine was moving beyond
the Texas School Book Depository Building in a southwesterly direction
on Elm Street between Houston Street and the Triple Underpass.[C3-260]
The general location of the car was described and marked on maps by
eyewitnesses as precisely as their observations and recollections
permitted.[C3-261] More exact information was provided by motion
pictures taken by Abraham Zapruder, Orville O. Nix and Mary Muchmore,
who were spectators at the scene.[C3-262] Substantial light has been
shed on the assassination sequence by viewing these motion pictures,
particularly the Zapruder film, which was the most complete and from
which individual 35-millimeter slides were made of each motion picture
frame.[C3-263]

Examination of the Zapruder motion picture camera by the FBI
established that 18.3 pictures or frames were taken each second,
and therefore, the timing of certain events could be calculated by
allowing 1/18.3 seconds for the action depicted from one frame to the
next.[C3-264] The films and slides made from individual frames were
viewed by Governor and Mrs. Connally, the Governor’s doctors, the
autopsy surgeons, and the Army wound ballistics scientists in order
to apply the knowledge of each to determine the precise course of
events.[C3-265] Tests of the assassin’s rifle disclosed that at least
2.3 seconds were required between shots.[C3-266] In evaluating the
films in the light of these timing guides, it was kept in mind that
a victim of a bullet wound may not react immediately and, in some
situations, according to experts, the victim may not even know where he
has been hit, or when.[C3-267]

On May 24, 1964, agents of the FBI and Secret Service conducted a
series of tests to determine as precisely as possible what happened
on November 22, 1963. Since the Presidential limousine was being
remodeled and was therefore unavailable, it was simulated by using
the Secret Service followup car, which is similar in design.[C3-268]
Any differences were taken into account. Two Bureau agents with
approximately the same physical characteristics sat in the car in the
same relative positions as President Kennedy and Governor Connally had
occupied. The back of the stand-in for the President was marked with
chalk at the point where the bullet entered. The Governor’s model had
on the same coat worn by Governor Connally when he was shot, with the
hole in the back circled in chalk.[C3-269]

To simulate the conditions which existed at the assassination scene
on November 22, the lower part of the sixth-floor window at the
southeast corner of the Depository Building was raised halfway, the
cardboard boxes were repositioned, the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle
found on the sixth floor of the Depository was used, and mounted on
that rifle was a camera which recorded the view as was seen by the
assassin.[C3-270] In addition, the Zapruder, Nix, and Muchmore cameras
were on hand so that photographs taken by these cameras from the same
locations where they were used on November 22, 1963, could be compared
with the films of that date.[C3-271] The agents ascertained that the
foliage of an oak tree that came between the gunman and his target
along the motorcade route on Elm Street was approximately the same as
on the day of the assassination.[C3-272]


The First Bullet That Hit

The position of President Kennedy’s car when he was struck in the
neck was determined with substantial precision from the films and
onsite tests. The pictures or frames in the Zapruder film were marked
by the agents, with the number “1” given to the first frame where
the motorcycles leading the motorcade came into view on Houston
Street.[C3-273] The numbers continue in sequence as Zapruder filmed
the Presidential limousine as it came around the corner and proceeded
down Elm. The President was in clear view of the assassin as he rode up
Houston Street and for 100 feet as he proceeded down Elm Street, until
he came to a point denoted as frame 166 on the Zapruder film.[C3-274]
These facts were determined in the test by placing the car and men
on Elm Street in the exact spot where they were when each frame of
the Zapruder film was photographed. To pinpoint their locations, a
man stood at Zapruder’s position and directed the automobile and both
models to the positions shown on each frame, after which a Bureau
photographer crouched at the sixth-floor window and looked through a
camera whose lens recorded the view through the telescopic sight of the
C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.[C3-275] (See Commission Exhibit No.
887, p. 99.) Each position was measured to determine how far President
Kennedy had gone down Elm from a point, which was designated as station
C, on a line drawn along the west curbline of Houston Street.[C3-276]

Based on these calculations, the agents concluded that at frame 166 of
the Zapruder film the President passed beneath the foliage of the large
oak tree and the point of impact on the President’s back disappeared
from the gunman’s view as seen through the telescopic lens.[C3-277]
(See Commission Exhibit No. 889, p. 100.) For a fleeting instant, the
President came back into view in the telescopic lens at frame 186 as
he appeared in an opening among the leaves.[C3-278] (See Commission
Exhibit No. 891, p. 101.) The test revealed that the next point at
which the rifleman had a clear view through the telescopic sight of
the point where the bullet entered the President’s back was when the
car emerged from behind the tree at frame 210.[C3-279] (See Commission
Exhibit No. 893, p. 102.) According to FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt,
“There is no obstruction from the sixth floor window from the time
they leave the tree until they disappear down toward the triple
overpass.”[C3-280]

As the President rode along Elm Street for a distance of about 140
feet, he was waving to the crowd.[C3-281] Shaneyfelt testified that
the waving is seen on the Zapruder movie until around frame 205, when
a road sign blocked out most of the President’s body from Zapruder’s
view through the lens of his camera. However, the assassin continued to
have a clear view of the President as he proceeded down Elm.[C3-282]
When President Kennedy again came fully into view in the Zapruder film
at frame 225, he seemed to be reacting to his neck wound by raising
his hands to his throat.[C3-283] (See Commission Exhibit No. 895, p.
103.) According to Shaneyfelt the reaction was “clearly apparent in 226
and barely apparent in 225.”[C3-284] It is probable that the President
was not shot before frame 210, since it is unlikely that the assassin
would deliberately have shot at him with a view obstructed by the oak
tree when he was about to have a clear opportunity. It is also doubtful
that even the most proficient marksman would have hit him through the
oak tree. In addition, the President’s reaction is “barely apparent”
in frame 225, which is 15 frames or approximately eight-tenths second
after frame 210, and a shot much before 210 would assume a longer
reaction time than was recalled by eyewitnesses at the scene. Thus,
the evidence indicated that the President was not hit until at least
frame 210 and that he was probably hit by frame 225. The possibility
of variations in reaction time in addition to the obstruction of
Zapruder’s view by the sign precluded a more specific determination
than that the President was probably shot through the neck between
frames 210 and 225, which marked his position between 138.9 and 153.8
feet west of station C.[C3-285]

According to Special Agent Robert A. Frazier, who occupied the position
of the assassin in the sixth-floor window during the reenactment,
it is likely that the bullet which passed through the President’s
neck, as described previously, then struck the automobile or someone
else in the automobile.[C3-286] The minute examination by the FBI
inspection team, conducted in Washington between 14 and 16 hours
after the assassination, revealed no damage indicating that a bullet
struck any part of the interior of the Presidential limousine, with
the exception of the cracking of the windshield and the dent on the
windshield chrome.[C3-287] Neither of these points of damage to the car
could have been caused by the bullet which exited from the President’s
neck at a velocity of 1,772 to 1,779 feet per second.[C3-288] If the
trajectory had permitted the bullet to strike the windshield, the
bullet would have penetrated it and traveled a substantial distance
down the road unless it struck some other object en route.[C3-289] Had
that bullet struck the metal framing, which was dented, it would have
torn a hole in the chrome and penetrated the framing, both inside and
outside the car.[C3-290] At that exit velocity, the bullet would have
penetrated any other metal or upholstery surface of the interior of the
automobile.[C3-291]

The bullet that hit President Kennedy in the back and exited through
his throat most likely could not have missed both the automobile
and its occupants. Since it did not hit the automobile, Frazier
testified that it probably struck Governor Connally.[C3-292] The
relative positions of President Kennedy and Governor Connally at
the time when the President was struck in the neck confirm that the
same bullet probably passed through both men. Pictures taken of the
President’s limousine on November 22, 1963, showed that the Governor
sat immediately in front of the President.[C3-293] Even though the
precise distance cannot be ascertained, it is apparent that President
Kennedy was somewhat to the Governor’s right. The President sat on the
extreme right, as noted in the films and by eyewitnesses, while the
right edge of the jump seat in which the Governor sat is 6 inches from
the right door.[C3-294] (See Commission Exhibit No. 697, p. 104.) The
President wore a back brace which tended to make him sit up straight,
and the Governor also sat erect since the jump seat gave him little leg
room.[C3-295]

Based on his observations during the reenactment and the position of
Governor Connally shown in the Zapruder film after the car emerged
from behind the sign, Frazier testified that Governor Connally was in
a position during the span from frame 207 to frame 225 to receive a
bullet which would have caused the wounds he actually suffered.[C3-296]
Governor Connally viewed the film and testified that he was hit between
frames 231 and 234.[C3-297] According to Frazier, between frames 235
and 240 the Governor turned sharply to his right, so that by frame
240 he was too far to the right to have received his injuries at that
time.[C3-298] At some point between frames 235 and 240, therefore,
is the last occasion when Governor Connally could have received his
injuries, since in the frames following 240 he remained turned too
far to his right.[C3-299] If Governor Connally was hit by a separate
shot between frames 235 and 240 which followed the shot which hit the
President’s neck, it would follow that: (1) the assassin’s first shot,
assuming a minimum firing time of 2.3 seconds (or 42 frames), was fired
between frames 193 and 198 when his view was obscured by the oak tree;
(2) President Kennedy continued waving to the crowd after he was hit
and did not begin to react for about 1½ seconds; and (3) the first
shot, although hitting no bones in the President’s body, was deflected
after its exit from the President’s neck in such a way that it failed
to hit either the automobile or any of the other occupants.

Viewed through the telescopic sight of the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle from the sixth-floor window during the test, the marks that
simulated the entry wounds on the stand-ins for the President and the
Governor were generally in a straight line. That alinement became
obvious to the viewer through the scope as the Governor’s model
turned slightly to his right and assumed the position which Governor
Connally had described as his position when he was struck. Viewing
the stand-ins for the President and the Governor in the sight of the
C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle at the location depicted in frames
207 and 210, Frazier testified: “They both are in direct alinement
with the telescopic sight at the window. The Governor is immediately
behind the President in the field of view.”[C3-300] (See Commission
Exhibit No. 893, p. 102.) A surveyor then placed his sighting equipment
at the precise point of entry on the back of the President’s neck,
assuming that the President was struck at frame 210, and measured the
angle to the end of the muzzle of the rifle positioned where it was
believed to have been held by the assassin.[C3-301] That angle measured
21°34’.[C3-302] From the same points of reference, the angle at frame
225 was measured at 20°11’, giving an average angle of 20°52’30” from
frame 210 to frame 225.[C3-303] Allowing for a downward street grade of
3°9’, the probable angle through the President’s body was calculated at
17°43’30”, assuming that he was sitting in a vertical position.[C3-304]

That angle was consistent with the trajectory of a bullet passing
through the President’s neck and then striking Governor Connally’s
back, causing the wounds which were discussed above. Shortly after
that angle was ascertained, the open car and the stand-ins were
taken by the agents to a nearby garage where a photograph was taken
to determine through closer study whether the angle of that shot
could have accounted for the wounds in the President’s neck and the
Governor’s back.[C3-305] A rod was placed at an angle of 17°43’30” next
to the stand-ins for the President and the Governor, who were seated in
the same relative positions.[C3-306] The wounds of entry and exit on
the President were approximated based on information gained from the
autopsy reports and photographs.[C3-307] The hole in the back of the
jacket worn by the Governor and the medical description of the wound
on his back marked that entry point.[C3-308] That line of fire from
the sixth floor of the Depository would have caused the bullet to exit
under the Governor’s right nipple just as the bullet did. Governor
Connally’s doctors measured an angle of declination on his body from
the entry wound on his back to the exit on the front of his chest at
about 25° when he sat erect.[C3-309] That difference was explained
by either a slight deflection of the bullet caused by striking the
fifth rib or the Governor’s leaning slightly backward at the time he
was struck. In addition, the angle could not be fixed with absolute
precision, since the large wound on the front of his chest precluded an
exact determination of the point of exit.[C3-310]

The alinement of the points of entry was only indicative and not
conclusive that one bullet hit both men. The exact positions of
the men could not be re-created; thus, the angle could only be
approximated.[C3-311] Had President Kennedy been leaning forward or
backward, the angle of declination of the shot to a perpendicular
target would have varied. The angle of 17°43’30” was approximately
the angle of declination reproduced in an artist’s drawing.[C3-312]
That drawing, made from data provided by the autopsy surgeons, could
not reproduce the exact line of the bullet, since the exit wound
was obliterated by the tracheotomy. Similarly, if the President or
the Governor had been sitting in a different lateral position, the
conclusion might have varied. Or if the Governor had not turned in
exactly the way calculated, the alinement would have been destroyed.

Additional experiments by the Army Wound Ballistics Branch further
suggested that the same bullet probably passed through both President
Kennedy and Governor Connally. (See app. X, pp. 582-585.) Correlation
of a test simulating the Governor’s chest wound with the neck and
wrist experiments indicated that course. After reviewing the Parkland
Hospital medical records and X-rays of the Governor and discussing his
chest injury with the attending surgeon, the Army ballistics experts
virtually duplicated the wound using the assassination weapon and
animal flesh covered by cloth.[C3-313] The bullet that struck the
animal flesh displayed characteristics similar to the bullet found on
Governor Connally’s stretcher.[C3-314] Moreover, the imprint on the
velocity screen immediately behind the animal flesh showed that the
bullet was tumbling after exiting from the flesh, having lost a total
average of 265 feet per second.[C3-315] Taking into consideration the
Governor’s size, the reduction in velocity of a bullet passing through
his body would be approximately 400 feet per second.[C3-316]

Based upon the medical evidence on the wounds of the Governor and
the President and the wound ballistics tests performed at Edgewood
Arsenal, Drs. Olivier and Arthur J. Dziemian, chief of the Army
Wound Ballistics Branch, who had spent 17 years in that area of
specialization, concluded that it was probable that the same bullet
passed through the President’s neck and then inflicted all the wounds
on the Governor.[C3-317] Referring to the President’s neck wound
and all the Governor’s wounds, Dr. Dziemian testified: “I think the
probability is very good that it is, that all the wounds were caused
by one bullet.”[C3-318] Both Drs. Dziemian and Olivier believed that
the wound on the Governor’s wrist would have been more extensive had
the bullet which inflicted that injury merely passed through the
Governor’s chest, exiting at a velocity of approximately 1,500 feet per
second.[C3-319] Thus, the Governor’s wrist wound suggested that the
bullet passed through the President’s neck, began to yaw in the air
between the President and the Governor, and then lost more velocity
than 400 feet per second in passing through the Governor’s chest. A
bullet which was yawing on entering into the Governor’s back would
lose substantially more velocity in passing through his body than
a pristine bullet.[C3-320] In addition, the bullet that struck the
animal flesh was flattened to a greater extent than the bullet which
presumably struck the Governor’s rib,[C3-321] which suggests that the
bullet which entered the Governor’s chest had already lost velocity
by passing through the President’s neck. Moreover, the large wound on
the Governor’s back would be explained by a bullet which was yawing,
although that type of wound might also be accounted for by a tangential
striking.[C3-322]

Dr. Frederick W. Light, Jr., the third of the wound ballistics experts,
who has been engaged in that specialty at Edgewood Arsenal since 1951,
testified that the anatomical findings were insufficient for him to
formulate a firm opinion as to whether the same bullet did or did not
pass through the President’s neck first before inflicting all the
wounds on Governor Connally.[C3-323] Based on the other circumstances,
such as the relative positions of the President and the Governor in
the automobile, Dr. Light concluded that it was probable that the same
bullet traversed the President’s neck and inflicted all the wounds on
Governor Connally.[C3-324]


The Subsequent Bullet That Hit

After a bullet penetrated President Kennedy’s neck, a subsequent shot
entered the back of his head and exited through the upper right portion
of his skull. The Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore films show the instant in
the sequence when that bullet struck. (See Commission Exhibit No. 902,
p. 108.) That impact was evident from the explosion of the President’s
brain tissues from the right side of his head. The immediately
preceding frame from the Zapruder film shows the President slumped to
his left, clutching at his throat, with his chin close to his chest and
his head tilted forward at an angle.[C3-325] Based upon information
provided by the doctors who conducted the autopsy, an artist’s drawing
depicted the path of the bullet through the President’s head, with his
head being in the same approximate position.[C3-326]

By using the Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore motion pictures, the
President’s location at the time the bullet penetrated his head was
fixed with reasonable precision. A careful analysis of the Nix and
Muchmore films led to fixing the exact location of these cameramen. The
point of impact of the bullet on the President’s head was apparent in
all of the movies. At that point in the Nix film a straight line was
plotted from the camera position to a fixed point in the background
and the President’s location along this line was marked on a plat
map.[C3-327] A similar process was followed with the Muchmore film. The
President’s location on the plat map was identical to that determined
from the Nix film.[C3-328] The President’s location, established
through the Nix and Muchmore films, was confirmed by comparing his
position on the Zapruder film. This location had hitherto only been
approximated, since there were no landmarks in the background of the
Zapruder frame for alinement purposes other than a portion of a painted
line on the curb.[C3-329] Through these procedures, it was determined
that President Kennedy was shot in the head when he was 230.8 feet from
a point on the west curbline on Houston Street where it intersected
with Elm Street.[C3-330] The President was 265.3 feet from the rifle in
the sixth-floor window and at that position the approximate angle of
declination was 15°21’.[C3-331]


NUMBER OF SHOTS

The consensus among the witnesses at the scene was that three shots
were fired.[C3-332] However, some heard only two shots,[C3-333] while
others testified that they heard four and perhaps as many as five
or six shots.[C3-334] The difficulty of accurate perception of the
sound of gunshots required careful scrutiny of all of this testimony
regarding the number of shots. The firing of a bullet causes a number
of noises: the muzzle blast, caused by the smashing of the hot gases
which propel the bullet into the relatively stable air at the gun’s
muzzle; the noise of the bullet, caused by the shock wave built up
ahead of the bullet’s nose as it travels through the air; and the noise
caused by the impact of the bullet on its target.[C3-335] Each noise
can be quite sharp and may be perceived as a separate shot. The tall
buildings in the area might have further distorted the sound.

The physical and other evidence examined by the Commission compels
the conclusion that at least two shots were fired. As discussed
previously, the nearly whole bullet discovered at Parkland Hospital
and the two larger fragments found in the Presidential automobile,
which were identified as coming from the assassination rifle, came from
at least two separate bullets and possibly from three.[C3-336] The
most convincing evidence relating to the number of shots was provided
by the presence on the sixth floor of three spent cartridges which
were demonstrated to have been fired by the same rifle that fired the
bullets which caused the wounds. It is possible that the assassin
carried an empty shell in the rifle and fired only two shots, with the
witnesses hearing multiple noises made by the same shot. Soon after
the three empty cartridges were found, officials at the scene decided
that three shots were fired, and that conclusion was widely circulated
by the press. The eyewitness testimony may be subconsciously colored
by the extensive publicity given the conclusion that three shots were
fired. Nevertheless, the preponderance of the evidence, in particular
the three spent cartridges, led the Commission to conclude that there
were three shots fired.


THE SHOT THAT MISSED

From the initial findings that (_a_) one shot passed through the
President’s neck and then most probably passed through the Governor’s
body, (_b_) a subsequent shot penetrated the President’s head, (_c_)
no other shot struck any part of the automobile, and (_d_) three shots
were fired, it follows that one shot probably missed the car and its
occupants. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether it was the first,
second, or third shot which missed.


The First Shot

If the first shot missed, the assassin perhaps missed in an effort to
fire a hurried shot before the President passed under the oak tree, or
possibly he fired as the President passed under the tree and the tree
obstructed his view. The bullet might have struck a portion of the tree
and been completely deflected. On the other hand, the greatest cause
for doubt that the first shot missed is the improbability that the
same marksman who twice hit a moving target would be so inaccurate on
the first and closest of his shots as to miss completely, not only the
target, but the large automobile.

Some support for the contention that the first shot missed is found in
the statement of Secret Service Agent Glen A. Bennett, stationed in
the right rear seat of the President’s followup car, who heard a sound
like a firecracker as the motorcade proceeded down Elm Street. At that
moment, Agent Bennett stated:

    * * * I looked at the back of the President. I heard another
    firecracker noise and saw that shot hit the President about
    four inches down from the right shoulder. A second shot
    followed immediately and hit the right rear high of the
    President’s head.[C3-337]

Substantial weight may be given Bennett’s observations. Although his
formal statement was dated November 23, 1963, his notes indicate that
he recorded what he saw and heard at 5:30 p.m., November 22, 1963, on
the airplane en route back to Washington, prior to the autopsy, when it
was not yet known that the President had been hit in the back.[C3-338]
It is possible, of course, that Bennett did not observe the hole in
the President’s back, which might have been there immediately after the
first noise.

Governor Connally’s testimony supports the view that the first shot
missed, because he stated that he heard a shot, turned slightly to his
right, and, as he started to turn back toward his left, was struck
by the second bullet.[C3-339] He never saw the President during the
shooting sequence, and it is entirely possible that he heard the missed
shot and that both men were struck by the second bullet. Mrs. Connally
testified that after the first shot she turned and saw the President’s
hands moving toward his throat, as seen in the films at frame
225.[C3-340] However, Mrs. Connally further stated that she thought her
husband was hit immediately thereafter by the second bullet.[C3-341]
If the same bullet struck both the President and the Governor, it is
entirely possible that she saw the President’s movements at the same
time as she heard the second shot. Her testimony, therefore, does not
preclude the possibility of the first shot having missed.

Other eyewitness testimony, however, supports the conclusion that the
first of the shots fired hit the President. As discussed in chapter II,
Special Agent Hill’s testimony indicates that the President was hit by
the first shot and that the head injury was caused by a second shot
which followed about 5 seconds later. James W. Altgens, a photographer
in Dallas for the Associated Press, had stationed himself on Elm Street
opposite the Depository to take pictures of the passing motorcade.
Altgens took a widely circulated photograph which showed President
Kennedy reacting to the first of the two shots which hit him. (See
Commission Exhibit No. 900, p. 113.) According to Altgens, he snapped
the picture “almost simultaneously” with a shot which he is confident
was the first one fired.[C3-342] Comparison of his photograph with
the Zapruder film, however, revealed that Altgens took his picture
at approximately the same moment as frame 255 of the movie, 30 to
45 frames (approximately 2 seconds) later than the point at which
the President was shot in the neck.[C3-343] (See Commission Exhibit
No. 901, p. 114.) Another photographer, Phillip L. Willis, snapped
a picture at a time which he also asserts was simultaneous with the
first shot. Analysis of his photograph revealed that it was taken at
approximately frame 210 of the Zapruder film, which was the approximate
time of the shot that probably hit the President and the Governor. If
Willis accurately recalled that there were no previous shots, this
would be strong evidence that the first shot did not miss.[C3-344]

If the first shot did not miss, there must be an explanation for
Governor Connally’s recollection that he was not hit by it. There was,
conceivably, a delayed reaction between the time the bullet struck him
and the time he realized that he was hit, despite the fact that the
bullet struck a glancing blow to a rib and penetrated his wrist bone.
The Governor did not even know that he had been struck in the wrist or
in the thigh until he regained consciousness in the hospital the next
day. Moreover, he testified that he did not hear what he thought was
the second shot, although he did hear a subsequent shot which coincided
with the shattering of the President’s head.[C3-345] One possibility,
therefore, would be a sequence in which the Governor heard the first
shot, did not immediately feel the penetration of the bullet, then
felt the delayed reaction of the impact on his back, later heard the
shot which shattered the President’s head, and then lost consciousness
without hearing a third shot which might have occurred later.

The Second Shot

The possibility that the second shot missed is consistent with the
elapsed time between the two shots that hit their mark. From the timing
evidenced by the Zapruder films, there was an interval of from 4.8 to
5.6 seconds between the shot which struck President Kennedy’s neck
(between frames 210 to 225) and the shot which struck his head at frame
313.[C3-346] Since a minimum of 2.3 seconds must elapse between shots,
a bullet could have been fired from the rifle and missed during this
interval.[C3-347] This possibility was buttressed by the testimony of
witnesses who claimed that the shots were evenly spaced, since a second
shot occurring within an interval of approximately 5 seconds would have
to be almost exactly midway in this period. If Altgens’ recollection
is correct that he snapped his picture at the same moment as he heard
a shot, then it is possible that he heard a second shot which missed,
since a shot fired 2.3 seconds before he took his picture at frame 255
could have hit the President at about frame 213.

On the other hand, a substantial majority of the witnesses stated that
the shots were not evenly spaced. Most witnesses recalled that the
second and third shots were bunched together, although some believed
that it was the first and second which were bunched.[C3-348] To the
extent that reliance can be placed on recollection of witnesses as to
the spacing of the shots, the testimony that the shots were not evenly
spaced would militate against a second shot missing. Another factor
arguing against the second shot missing is that the gunman would have
been shooting at very near the minimum allowable time to have fired
the three shots within 4.8 to 5.6 seconds, although it was entirely
possible for him to have done so. (See ch. IV, pp. 188-194.)


The Third Shot

The last possibility, of course, is that it was the third shot which
missed. This conclusion conforms most easily with the probability
that the assassin would most likely have missed the farthest shot,
particularly since there was an acceleration of the automobile after
the shot which struck the President’s head. The limousine also changed
direction by following the curve to the right, whereas previously it
had been proceeding in almost a straight line with a rifle protruding
from the sixth-floor window of the Depository Building.

One must consider, however, the testimony of the witnesses who
described the head shot as the concluding event in the assassination
sequence. Illustrative is the testimony of Associated Press
photographer Altgens, who had an excellent vantage point near the
President’s car. He recalled that the shot which hit the President’s
head “was the last shot--that much I will say with a great degree
of certainty.”[C3-349] On the other hand, Emmett J. Hudson, the
groundskeeper of Dealey Plaza, testified that from his position on
Elm Street, midway between Houston Street and the Triple Underpass,
he heard a third shot after the shot which hit the President in the
head.[C3-350] In addition, Mrs. Kennedy’s testimony indicated that
neither the first nor the second shot missed. Immediately after the
first noise she turned, because of the Governor’s yell, and saw her
husband raise his hand to his forehead. Then the second shot struck the
President’s head.[C3-351]

Some evidence suggested that a third shot may have entirely missed and
hit the turf or street by the Triple Underpass. Royce G. Skelton, who
watched the motorcade from the railroad bridge, testified that after
two shots “the car came on down close to the Triple Underpass” and an
additional shot “hit in the left front of the President’s car on the
cement.”[C3-352] Skelton thought that there had been a total of four
shots, either the third or fourth of which hit in the vicinity of the
underpass.[C3-353] Dallas Patrolman J. W. Foster, who was also on the
Triple Underpass, testified that a shot hit the turf near a manhole
cover in the vicinity of the underpass.[C3-354] Examination of this
area, however, disclosed no indication that a bullet struck at the
locations indicated by Skelton or Foster.[C3-355]

At a different location in Dealey Plaza, the evidence indicated that a
bullet fragment did hit the street. James T. Tague, who got out of his
car to watch the motorcade from a position between Commerce and Main
Streets near the Triple Underpass, was hit on the cheek by an object
during the shooting.[C3-356] Within a few minutes Tague reported this
to Deputy Sheriff Eddy R. Walthers, who was examining the area to
see if any bullets had struck the turf.[C3-357] Walthers immediately
started to search where Tague had been standing and located a place on
the south curb of Main Street where it appeared a bullet had hit the
cement.[C3-358] According to Tague, “There was a mark quite obviously
that was a bullet, and it was very fresh.”[C3-359] In Tague’s opinion,
it was the second shot which caused the mark, since he thinks he heard
the third shot after he was hit in the face.[C3-360] This incident
appears to have been recorded in the contemporaneous report of Dallas
Patrolman L. L. Hill, who radioed in around 12:40 p.m.: “I have one
guy that was possibly hit by a richochet from the bullet off the
concrete.”[C3-361] Scientific examination of the mark on the south
curb of Main Street by FBI experts disclosed metal smears which, “were
spectrographically determined to be essentially lead with a trace
of antimony.”[C3-362] The mark on the curb could have originated
from the lead core of a bullet but the absence of copper precluded
“the possibility that the mark on the curbing section was made by an
unmutilated military full metal-jacketed bullet such as the bullet from
Governor Connally’s stretcher.”[C3-363]

It is true that the noise of a subsequent shot might have been drowned
out by the siren on the Secret Service followup car immediately
after the head shot, or the dramatic effect of the head shot might
have caused so much confusion that the memory of subsequent events
was blurred. Nevertheless, the preponderance of the eyewitness
testimony that the head shot was the final shot must be weighed in any
determination as to whether it was the third shot that missed. Even
if it were caused by a bullet fragment, the mark on the south curb of
Main Street cannot be identified conclusively with any of the three
shots fired. Under the circumstances it might have come from the bullet
which hit the President’s head, or it might have been a product of the
fragmentation of the missed shot upon hitting some other object in the
area.[C3-364] Since he did not observe any of the shots striking the
President, Tague’s testimony that the second shot, rather than the
third, caused the scratch on his cheek, does not assist in limiting the
possibilities.

The wide range of possibilities and the existence of conflicting
testimony, when coupled with the impossibility of scientific
verification, precludes a conclusive finding by the Commission as to
which shot missed.


TIME SPAN OF SHOTS

Witnesses at the assassination scene said that the shots were
fired within a few seconds, with the general estimate being 5 to 6
seconds.[C3-365] That approximation was most probably based on the
earlier publicized reports that the first shot struck the President in
the neck, the second wounded the Governor and the third shattered the
President’s head, with the time span from the neck to the head shots on
the President being approximately 5 seconds. As previously indicated,
the time span between the shot entering the back of the President’s
neck and the bullet which shattered his skull was 4.8 to 5.6 seconds.
If the second shot missed, then 4.8 to 5.6 seconds was the total time
span of the shots. If either the first or third shots missed, then a
minimum of 2.3 seconds (necessary to operate the rifle) must be added
to the time span of the shots which hit, giving a minimum time of 7.1
to 7.9 seconds for the three shots. If more than 2.3 seconds elapsed
between a shot that missed and one that hit, then the time span would
be correspondingly increased.


CONCLUSION

Based on the evidence analyzed in this chapter, the Commission has
concluded that the shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded
Governor Connally were fired from the sixth-floor window at the
southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository Building. Two
bullets probably caused all the wounds suffered by President Kennedy
and Governor Connally. Since the preponderance of the evidence
indicated that three shots were fired, the Commission concluded that
one shot probably missed the Presidential limousine and its occupants,
and that the three shots were fired in a time period ranging from
approximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds.




CHAPTER IV

The Assassin


The preceding chapter has established that the bullets which killed
President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired from the
southeast corner window of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book
Depository Building and that the weapon which fired these bullets was
a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle bearing the serial
number C2766. In this chapter the Commission evaluates the evidence
upon which it has based its conclusion concerning the identity of the
assassin. This evidence includes (1) the ownership and possession of
the weapon used to commit the assassination, (2) the means by which the
weapon was brought into the Depository Building, (3) the identity of
the person present at the window from which the shots were fired, (4)
the killing of Dallas Patrolman J.D. Tippit within 45 minutes after the
assassination, (5) the resistance to arrest and the attempted shooting
of another police officer by the man (Lee Harvey Oswald) subsequently
accused of assassinating President Kennedy and killing Patrolman
Tippit, (6) the lies told to the police by Oswald, (7) the evidence
linking Oswald to the attempted killing of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker
(Resigned, U.S. Army) on April 10, 1963, and (8) Oswald’s capability
with a rifle.


OWNERSHIP AND POSSESSION OF ASSASSINATION WEAPON

Purchase of Rifle by Oswald

Shortly after the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was found on the sixth floor
of the Texas School Book Depository Building,[C4-1] agents of the FBI
learned from retail outlets in Dallas that Crescent Firearms, Inc.,
of New York City, was a distributor of surplus Italian 6.5-millimeter
military rifles.[C4-2] During the evening of November 22, 1963, a
review of the records of Crescent Firearms revealed that the firm had
shipped an Italian carbine, serial number C2766, to Klein’s Sporting
Goods Co., of Chicago, Ill.[C4-3] After searching their records from
10 p.m. to 4 a.m. the officers of Klein’s discovered that a rifle
bearing serial number C2766 had been shipped to one A. Hidell, Post
Office Box 2915, Dallas, Tex., on March 20, 1963.[C4-4] (See Waldman
Exhibit No. 7, p. 120.)

According to its microfilm records, Klein’s received an order for a
rifle on March 13, 1963, on a coupon clipped from the February 1963
issue of the American Rifleman magazine. The order coupon was signed,
in handprinting, “A. Hidell, P.O. Box 2915, Dallas, Texas.” (See
Commission Exhibit No. 773, p. 120.) It was sent in an envelope bearing
the same name and return address in handwriting. Document examiners
for the Treasury Department and the FBI testified unequivocally that
the bold printing on the face of the mail-order coupon was in the
handprinting of Lee Harvey Oswald and that the writing on the envelope
was also his.[C4-5] Oswald’s writing on these and other documents was
identified by comparing the writing and printing on the documents in
question with that appearing on documents known to have been written by
Oswald, such as his letters, passport application, and endorsements of
checks.[C4-6] (See app. X, p. 568-569.)

In addition to the order coupon the envelope contained a U.S. postal
money order for $21.45, purchased as No. 2,202,130,462 in Dallas,
Tex., on March 12, 1963.[C4-7] The canceled money order was obtained
from the Post Office Department. Opposite the printed words “Pay To”
were written the words “Kleins Sporting Goods,” and opposite the
printed word “From” were written the words “A. Hidell, P.O. Box 2915
Dallas, Texas.” These words were also in the handwriting of Lee Harvey
Oswald.[C4-8] (See Commission Exhibit No. 788, p. 120.)

From Klein’s records it was possible to trace the processing of the
order after its receipt. A bank deposit made on March 13, 1963,
included an item of $21.45. Klein’s shipping order form shows an
imprint made by the cash register which recorded the receipt of $21.45
on March 13, 1963. This price included $19.95 for the rifle and the
scope, and $1.50 for postage and handling. The rifle without the scope
cost only $12.78.[C4-9]

According to the vice president of Klein’s, William Waldman, the scope
was mounted on the rifle by a gunsmith employed by Klein’s, and the
rifle was shipped fully assembled in accordance with customary company
procedures.[C4-10] The specific rifle shipped against the order had
been received by Klein’s from Crescent on February 21, 1963. It bore
the manufacturer’s serial number C2766. On that date, Klein’s placed
an internal control number VC836 on this rifle.[C4-11] According to
Klein’s shipping order form, one Italian carbine 6.5 X-4× scope,
control number VC836, serial number C2766, was shipped parcel post to
“A. Hidell, P.O. Box 2915, Dallas, Texas,” on March 20, 1963.[C4-12]
Information received from the Italian Armed Forces Intelligence Service
has established that this particular rifle was the only rifle of its
type bearing serial number C2766.[C4-13] (See app. X, p. 554.)

The post office box to which the rifle was shipped was rented to “Lee
H. Oswald” from October 9, 1962, to May 14, 1963.[C4-14] Experts on
handwriting identification from the Treasury Department and the FBI
testified that the signature and other writing on the application for
that box were in the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald,[C4-15] as was
a change-of-address card dated May 12, 1963,[C4-16] by which Oswald
requested that mail addressed to that box be forwarded to him in New
Orleans, where he had moved on April 24.[C4-17] Since the rifle was
shipped from Chicago on March 20, 1963, it was received in Dallas
during the period when Oswald rented and used the box. (See Commission
Exhibit No. 791, p. 120.)

It is not known whether the application for post office box 2915
listed “A. Hidell” as a person entitled to receive mail at this box.
In accordance with postal regulations, the portion of the application
which lists names of persons, other than the applicant, entitled to
receive mail was thrown away after the box was closed on May 14,
1963.[C4-18] Postal Inspector Harry D. Holmes of the Dallas Post Office
testified, however, that when a package is received for a certain
box, a notice is placed in that box regardless of whether the name
on the package is listed on the application as a person entitled to
receive mail through that box. The person having access to the box then
takes the notice to the window and is given the package. Ordinarily,
Inspector Holmes testified, identification is not requested because
it is assumed that the person with the notice is entitled to the
package.[C4-19]

Oswald’s use of the name “Hidell” to purchase the assassination weapon
was one of several instances in which he used this name as an alias.
When arrested on the day of the assassination, he had in his possession
a Smith & Wesson .38 caliber revolver[C4-20] purchased by mail-order
coupon from Seaport-Traders, Inc., a mail-order division of George
Rose & Co., Los Angeles. The mail-order coupon listed the purchaser
as “A. J. Hidell Age 28” with the address of post office box 2915
in Dallas.[C4-21] Handwriting experts from the FBI and the Treasury
Department testified that the writing on the mail-order form was that
of Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-22]

Among other identification cards in Oswald’s wallet at the time of his
arrest were a Selective Service notice of classification, a Selective
Service registration certificate,[C4-23] and a certificate of service
in the U.S. Marine Corps,[C4-24] all three cards being in his own
name. Also in his wallet at that time were a Selective Service notice
of classification and a Marine certificate of service in the name
of Alek James Hidell.[C4-25] On the Hidell Selective Service card
there appeared a signature, “Alek J. Hidell,” and the photograph of
Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-26] Experts on questioned documents from the
Treasury Department and the FBI testified that the Hidell cards were
counterfeit photographic reproductions made by photographing the
Oswald cards, retouching the resulting negatives, and producing prints
from the retouched negatives. The Hidell signature on the notice of
classification was in the handwriting of Oswald.[C4-27] (See app. X, p.
572.)

In Oswald’s personal effects found in his room at 1026 North
Beckley Avenue in Dallas was a purported international certificate
of vaccination signed by “Dr. A. J. Hideel,” Post Office Box 30016,
New Orleans.[C4-28] It certified that Lee Harvey Oswald had been
vaccinated for smallpox on June 8, 1963. This, too, was a forgery.
The signature of “A. J. Hideel” was in the handwriting of Lee Harvey
Oswald.[C4-29] There is no “Dr. Hideel” licensed to practice medicine
in Louisiana.[C4-30] There is no post office box 30016 in the New
Orleans Post Office but Oswald had rented post office box 30061 in New
Orleans[C4-31] on June 3, 1963, listing Marina Oswald and A. J. Hidell
as additional persons entitled to receive mail in the box.[C4-32]
The New Orleans postal authorities had not discarded the portion of
the application listing the names of those, other than the owner of
the box, entitled to receive mail through the box. Expert testimony
confirmed that the writing on this application was that of Lee Harvey
Oswald.[C4-33]

Hidell’s name on the post office box application was part of Oswald’s
use of a nonexistent Hidell to serve as president of the so-called New
Orleans Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. (As discussed
below in ch. VI, p. 292.) Marina Oswald testified that she first
learned of Oswald’s use of the fictitious name “Hidell” in connection
with his pro-Castro activities in New Orleans.[C4-34] According
to her testimony, he compelled her to write the name “Hidell” on
membership cards in the space designated for the signature of the
“Chapter President.”[C4-35] The name “Hidell” was stamped on some of
the “Chapter’s” printed literature and on the membership application
blanks.[C4-36] Marina Oswald testified, “I knew there was no such
organization. And I know Hidell is merely an altered Fidel, and I
laughed at such foolishness.”[C4-37] Hidell was a fictitious president
of an organization of which Oswald was the only member.[C4-38]

When seeking employment in New Orleans, Oswald listed a “Sgt. Robt.
Hidell” as a reference on one job application[C4-39] and “George
Hidell” as a reference on another.[C4-40] Both names were found to be
fictitious.[C4-41] Moreover, the use of “Alek” as a first name for
Hidell is a further link to Oswald because “Alek” was Oswald’s nickname
in Russia.[C4-42] Letters received by Marina Oswald from her husband
signed “Alek” were given to the Commission.[C4-43]


Oswald’s Palmprint on Rifle Barrel

Based on the above evidence, the Commission concluded that Oswald
purchased the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository
Building. Additional evidence of ownership was provided in the form of
palmprint identification which indicated that Oswald had possession of
the rifle he had purchased.

A few minutes after the rifle was discovered on the sixth floor of
the Depository Building[C4-44] it was examined by Lt. J. C. Day of
the identification bureau of the Dallas police. He lifted the rifle
by the wooden stock after his examination convinced him that the wood
was too rough to take fingerprints. Capt. J. W. Fritz then ejected a
cartridge by operating the bolt, but only after Day viewed the knob
on the bolt through a magnifying glass and found no prints.[C4-45]
Day continued to examine the rifle with the magnifying glass, looking
for possible fingerprints. He applied fingerprint powder to the side
of the metal housing near the trigger, and noticed traces of two
prints.[C4-46] At 11:45 p.m. on November 22, the rifle was released
to the FBI and forwarded to Washington where it was examined on the
morning of November 23 by Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the Latent
Fingerprint Section of the FBI’s Identification Division.[C4-47]

In his testimony before the Commission, Latona stated that when he
received the rifle, the area where prints were visible was protected by
cellophane.[C4-48] He examined these prints, as well as photographs of
them which the Dallas police had made, and concluded that:

    * * * the formations, the ridge formations and characteristics,
    were insufficient for purposes of either effecting
    identification or a determination that the print was not
    identical with the prints of people. Accordingly, my opinion
    simply was that the latent prints which were there were of no
    value.[C4-49]

Latona then processed the complete weapon but developed no identifiable
prints.[C4-50] He stated that the poor quality of the wood and the
metal would cause the rifle to absorb moisture from the skin, thereby
making a clear print unlikely.[C4-51]

On November 22, however, before surrendering possession of the rifle
to the FBI Laboratory, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas Police Department
had “lifted” a palmprint from the underside of the gun barrel “near
the firing end of the barrel about 3 inches under the Woodstock when I
took the Woodstock loose.”[C4-52] “Lifting” a print involves the use of
adhesive material to remove the fingerprint powder which adheres to the
original print. In this way the powdered impression is actually removed
from the object.[C4-53] The lifting had been so complete in this case
that there was no trace of the print on the rifle itself when it was
examined by Latona. Nor was there any indication that the lift had been
performed.[C4-54] Day, on the other hand, believed that sufficient
traces of the print had been left on the rifle barrel, because he
did not release the lifted print until November 26, when he received
instructions to send “everything that we had” to the FBI.[C4-55] The
print arrived in the FBI Laboratory in Washington on November 29,
mounted on a card on which Lieutenant Day had written the words “off
underside gun barrel near end of foregrip C2766.”[C4-56] The print’s
positive identity as having been lifted from the rifle was confirmed
by FBI Laboratory tests which established that the adhesive material
bearing the print also bore impressions of the same irregularities that
appeared on the barrel of the rifle.[C4-57]

Latona testified that this palmprint was the right palmprint of
Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-58] At the request of the Commission, Arthur
Mandella, fingerprint expert with the New York City Police Department,
conducted an independent examination and also determined that this
was the right palmprint of Oswald.[C4-59] Latona’s findings were also
confirmed by Ronald G. Wittmus, another FBI fingerprint expert.[C4-60]
In the opinion of these experts, it was not possible to estimate the
time which elapsed between the placing of the print on the rifle and
the date of the lift.[C4-61]

Experts testifying before the Commission agreed that palmprints
are as unique as fingerprints for purposes of establishing
identification.[C4-62] Oswald’s palmprint on the underside of the
barrel demonstrates that he handled the rifle when it was disassembled.
A palmprint could not be placed on this portion of the rifle, when
assembled, because the wooden foregrip covers the barrel at this
point.[C4-63] The print is additional proof that the rifle was in
Oswald’s possession.


Fibers on Rifle

In a crevice between the butt plate of the rifle and the wooden stock
was a tuft of several cotton fibers of dark blue, gray-black, and
orange-yellow shades.[C4-64] On November 23, 1963, these fibers were
examined by Paul M. Stombaugh, a special agent assigned to the Hair
and Fiber Unit of the FBI Laboratory.[C4-65] He compared them with the
fibers found in the shirt which Oswald was wearing when arrested in
the Texas Theatre.[C4-66] This shirt was also composed of dark blue,
gray-black and orange-yellow cotton fibers. Stombaugh testified that
the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the
rifle matched those in Oswald’s shirt.[C4-67] (See app. X, p. 592.)

Stombaugh explained in his testimony that in fiber analysis, as
distinct from fingerprint or firearms identification, it is not
possible to state with scientific certainty that a particular small
group of fibers come from a certain piece of clothing to the exclusion
of all others because there are not enough microscopic characteristics
present in fibers.[C4-68] Judgments as to probability will depend on
the number and types of matches.[C4-69] He concluded, “There is no
doubt in my mind that these fibers could have come from this shirt.
There is no way, however, to eliminate the possibility of the fibers
having come from another identical shirt.”[C4-70]

Having considered the probabilities as explained in Stombaugh’s
testimony, the Commission has concluded that the fibers in the tuft
on the rifle most probably came from the shirt worn by Oswald when he
was arrested, and that this was the same shirt which Oswald wore on
the morning of the assassination. Marina Oswald testified that she
thought her husband wore this shirt to work on that day.[C4-71] The
testimony of those who saw him after the assassination was inconclusive
about the color of Oswald’s shirt,[C4-72] but Mary Bledsoe, a former
landlady of Oswald, saw him on a bus approximately 10 minutes after
the assassination and identified the shirt as being the one worn by
Oswald primarily because of a distinctive hole in the shirt’s right
elbow.[C4-73] Moreover, the bus transfer which he obtained as he left
the bus was still in the pocket when he was arrested.[C4-74] Although
Oswald returned to his roominghouse after the assassination and when
questioned by the police, claimed to have changed his shirt,[C4-75] the
evidence indicates that he continued wearing the same shirt which he
was wearing all morning and which he was still wearing when arrested.

In light of these findings the Commission evaluated the additional
testimony of Stombaugh that the fibers were caught in the crevice of
the rifle’s butt plate “in the recent past.”[C4-76] Although Stombaugh
was unable to estimate the period of time the fibers were on the rifle
he said that the fibers “were clean, they had good color to them,
there was no grease on them and they were not fragmented. They looked
as if they had just been picked up.”[C4-77] The relative freshness
of the fibers is strong evidence that they were caught on the rifle
on the morning of the assassination or during the preceding evening.
For 10 days prior to the eve of the assassination Oswald had not been
present at Ruth Paine’s house in Irving, Tex.,[C4-78] where the rifle
was kept.[C4-79] Moreover, the Commission found no reliable evidence
that Oswald used the rifle at any time between September 23, when it
was transported from New Orleans, and November 22, the day of the
assassination.[C4-80] The fact that on the morning of the assassination
Oswald was wearing the shirt from which these relatively fresh fibers
most probably originated, provides some evidence that they were placed
on the rifle that day since there was limited, if any, opportunity for
Oswald to handle the weapon during the 2 months prior to November 22.

On the other hand Stombaugh pointed out that fibers might retain their
freshness if the rifle had been “put aside” after catching the fibers.
The rifle used in the assassination probably had been wrapped in a
blanket for about 8 weeks prior to November 22.[C4-81] Because the
relative freshness of these fibers might be explained by the continuous
storage of the rifle in the blanket, the Commission was unable to reach
any firm conclusion as to when the fibers were caught in the rifle. The
Commission was able to conclude, however, that the fibers most probably
came from Oswald’s shirt. This adds to the conviction of the Commission
that Oswald owned and handled the weapon used in the assassination.


Photograph of Oswald With Rifle

During the period from March 2, 1963, to April 24, 1963, the Oswalds
lived on Neely Street in Dallas in a rented house which had a small
back yard.[C4-82] One Sunday, while his wife was hanging diapers,
Oswald asked her to take a picture of him holding a rifle, a pistol
and issues of two newspapers later identified as the Worker and the
Militant.[C4-83] Two pictures were taken. The Commission has concluded
that the rifle shown in these pictures is the same rifle which was
found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building on November 22,
1963. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 133-A and 133-B, p. 126.)

One of these pictures, Exhibit No. 133-A, shows most of the rifle’s
configuration.[C4-84] Special Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, a photography
expert with the FBI, photographed the rifle used in the assassination,
attempting to duplicate the position of the rifle and the lighting in
Exhibit No. 133-A.[C4-85] After comparing the rifle in the simulated
photograph with the rifle in Exhibit No. 133-A, Shaneyfelt testified,
“I found it to be the same general configuration. All appearances were
the same.” He found “one notch in the stock at this point that appears
very faintly in the photograph.” He stated, however, that while he
“found no differences” between the rifles in the two photographs, he
could not make a “positive identification to the exclusion of all other
rifles of the same general configuration.”[C4-86]

[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPHS OF OSWALD HOLDING RIFLE

COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 133-A

COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 133-B

COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 134

(Enlargement of Commission Exhibit No. 133-A)]

The authenticity of these pictures has been established by expert
testimony which links the second picture, Commission Exhibit No. 133-B,
to Oswald’s Imperial Reflex camera, with which Marina Oswald testified
she took the pictures.[C4-87] The negative of that picture, Commission
Exhibit No. 133-B, was found among Oswald’s possessions.[C4-88]
Using a recognized technique of determining whether a picture was
taken with a particular camera, Shaneyfelt compared this negative
with a negative which he made by taking a new picture with Oswald’s
camera.[C4-89] He concluded that the negative of Exhibit No. 133-B was
exposed in Oswald’s Imperial Reflex camera to the exclusion of all
other cameras.[C4-90] He could not test Exhibit No. 133-A in the same
way because the negative was never recovered.[C4-91] Both pictures,
however, have identical backgrounds and lighting and, judging from the
shadows, were taken at the same angle. They are photographs of the
same scene.[C4-92] Since Exhibit No. 133-B was taken with Oswald’s
camera, it is reasonably certain that Exhibit No. 133-A was taken by
the same camera at the same time, as Marina Oswald testified. Moreover,
Shaneyfelt testified that in his opinion the photographs were not
composites of two different photographs and that Oswald’s face had not
been superimposed on another body.[C4-93]

One of the photographs taken by Marina Oswald was widely published
in newspapers and magazines, and in many instances the details of
these pictures differed from the original, and even from each other,
particularly as to the configuration of the rifle. The Commission
sought to determine whether these photographs were retouched prior
to publication. Shaneyfelt testified that the published photographs
appeared to be based on a copy of the original which the publications
had each retouched differently.[C4-94] Several of the publications
furnished the Commission with the prints they had used, or described by
correspondence the retouching they had done. This information enabled
the Commission to conclude that the published pictures were the same
as the original except for retouching done by these publications,
apparently for the purpose of clarifying the lines of the rifle and
other details in the picture.[C4-95]

The dates surrounding the taking of this picture and the purchase of
the rifle reinforce the belief that the rifle in the photograph is
the rifle which Oswald bought from Klein’s. The rifle was shipped
from Klein’s in Chicago on March 20, 1963, at a time when the Oswalds
were living on Neely Street.[C4-96] From an examination of one of
the photographs, the Commission determined the dates of the issues
of the Militant and the Worker which Oswald was holding in his hand.
By checking the actual mailing dates of these issues and the time it
usually takes to effect delivery to Dallas, it was established that the
photographs must have been taken sometime after March 27.[C4-97] Marina
Oswald testified that the photographs were taken on a Sunday about 2
weeks before the attempted shooting of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker on
April 10, 1963.[C4-98] By Sunday, March 31, 1963, 10 days prior to the
Walker attempt, Oswald had undoubtedly received the rifle shipped from
Chicago on March 20, the revolver shipped from Los Angeles on the same
date,[C4-99] and the two newspapers which he was holding in the picture.


Rifle Among Oswald’s Possessions

Marina Oswald testified that the rifle found on the sixth floor of the
Depository Building was the “fateful rifle of Lee Oswald.”[C4-100]
Moreover, it was the only rifle owned by her husband following his
return from the Soviet Union in June 1962.[C4-101] It had been
purchased in March 1963, and taken to New Orleans where Marina Oswald
saw it in their rented apartment during the summer of 1963.[C4-102]
It appears from his wife’s testimony that Oswald may have sat on the
screened-in porch at night practicing with the rifle by looking through
the telescopic sight and operating the bolt.[C4-103] In September 1963,
Oswald loaded their possessions into a station wagon owned by Ruth
Paine, who had invited Marina Oswald and the baby to live at her home
in Irving,[C4-104] Tex. Marina Oswald has stated that the rifle was
among these possessions,[C4-105] although Ruth Paine testified that she
was not aware of it.[C4-106]

From September 24, 1963, when Marina Oswald arrived in Irving from
New Orleans, until the morning of the assassination, the rifle was,
according to the evidence, stored in a green and brown blanket in the
Paines’ garage among the Oswalds’ other possessions.[C4-107] About 1
week after the return from New Orleans, Marina Oswald was looking in
the garage for parts to the baby’s crib and thought that the parts
might be in the blanket. When she started to open the blanket, she saw
the stock of the rifle.[C4-108] Ruth and Michael Paine both noticed the
rolled-up blanket in the garage during the time that Marina Oswald was
living in their home.[C4-109] On several occasions, Michael Paine moved
the blanket in the garage.[C4-110] He thought it contained tent poles,
or possibly other camping equipment such as a folding shovel.[C4-111]
When he appeared before the Commission, Michael Paine lifted the
blanket with the rifle wrapped inside and testified that it appeared
to be the same approximate weight and shape as the package in his
garage.[C4-112]

About 3 hours after the assassination, a detective and deputy sheriff
saw the blanket-roll, tied with a string, lying on the floor of the
Paines’ garage. Each man testified that he thought he could detect
the outline of a rifle in the blanket, even though the blanket was
empty.[C4-113] Paul M. Stombaugh, of the FBI Laboratory, examined the
blanket and discovered a bulge approximately 10 inches long midway
in the blanket. This bulge was apparently caused by a hard protruding
object which had stretched the blanket’s fibers. It could have been
caused by the telescopic sight of the rifle which was approximately 11
inches long.[C4-114] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, p. 132.)


Conclusion

Having reviewed the evidence that (1) Lee Harvey Oswald purchased the
rifle used in the assassination, (2) Oswald’s palmprint was on the
rifle in a position which shows that he had handled it while it was
disassembled, (3) fibers found on the rifle most probably came from
the shirt Oswald was wearing on the day of the assassination, (4) a
photograph taken in the yard of Oswald’s apartment showed him holding
this rifle, and (5) the rifle was kept among Oswald’s possessions
from the time of its purchase until the day of the assassination, the
Commission concluded that the rifle used to assassinate President
Kennedy and wound Governor Connally was owned and possessed by Lee
Harvey Oswald.


THE RIFLE IN THE BUILDING

The Commission has evaluated the evidence tending to show how Lee
Harvey Oswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, serial number C2766, was
brought into the Depository Building, where it was found on the
sixth floor shortly after the assassination. In this connection the
Commission considered (1) the circumstances surrounding Oswald’s return
to Irving, Tex., on Thursday, November 21, 1963, (2) the disappearance
of the rifle from its normal place of storage, (3) Oswald’s arrival at
the Depository Building on November 22, carrying a long and bulky brown
paper package, (4) the presence of a long handmade brown paper bag
near the point from which the shots were fired, and (5) the palmprint,
fiber, and paper analyses linking Oswald and the assassination weapon
to this bag.


The Curtain Rod Story

During October and November of 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald lived in a
roominghouse in Dallas while his wife and children lived in Irving,
at the home of Ruth Paine,[C4-115] approximately 15 miles from
Oswald’s place of work at the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald
traveled between Dallas and Irving on weekends in a car driven by a
neighbor of the Paines, Buell Wesley Frazier, who also worked at the
Depository.[C4-116] Oswald generally would go to Irving on Friday
afternoon and return to Dallas Monday morning. According to the
testimony of Frazier, Marina Oswald, and Ruth Paine, it appears that
Oswald never returned to Irving in midweek prior to November 21, 1963,
except on Monday, October 21, when he visited his wife in the hospital
after the birth of their second child.[C4-117]

During the morning of November 21, Oswald asked Frazier whether he
could ride home with him that afternoon. Frazier, surprised, asked
him why he was going to Irving on Thursday night rather than Friday.
Oswald replied, “I’m going home to get some curtain rods * * * [to]
put in an apartment.”[C4-118] The two men left work at 4:40 p.m. and
drove to Irving. There was little conversation between them on the way
home.[C4-119] Mrs. Linnie Mae Randle, Frazier’s sister, commented to
her brother about Oswald’s unusual midweek return to Irving. Frazier
told her that Oswald had come home to get curtain rods.[C4-120]

It would appear, however, that obtaining curtain rods was not the
purpose of Oswald’s trip to Irving on November 21. Mrs. A. C. Johnson,
his landlady, testified that Oswald’s room at 1026 North Beckley Avenue
had curtains and curtain rods,[C4-121] and that Oswald had never
discussed the subject with her.[C4-122] In the Paines’ garage, along
with many other objects of a household character, there were two flat
lightweight curtain rods belonging to Ruth Paine but they were still
there on Friday afternoon after Oswald’s arrest.[C4-123] Oswald never
asked Mrs. Paine about the use of curtain rods,[C4-124] and Marina
Oswald testified that Oswald did not say anything about curtain rods
on the day before the assassination.[C4-125] No curtain rods were
known to have been discovered in the Depository Building after the
assassination.[C4-126] In deciding whether Oswald carried a rifle to
work in a long paper bag on November 22, the Commission gave weight to
the fact that Oswald gave a false reason for returning home on November
21, and one which provided an excuse for the carrying of a bulky
package the following morning.


The Missing Rifle

Before dinner on November 21, Oswald played on the lawn of the Paines’
home with his daughter June.[C4-127] After dinner Ruth Paine and
Marina Oswald were busy cleaning house and preparing their children
for bed.[C4-128] Between the hours of 8 and 9 p.m. they were occupied
with the children in the bedrooms located at the extreme east end of
the house.[C4-129] On the west end of the house is the attached garage,
which can be reached from the kitchen or from the outside.[C4-130] In
the garage were the personal belongings of the Oswald family including,
as the evidence has shown, the rifle wrapped in the old brown and green
blanket.[C4-131]

At approximately 9 p.m., after the children had been put to bed, Mrs.
Paine, according to her testimony before the Commission, “went out to
the garage to paint some children’s blocks, and worked in the garage
for half an hour or so. I noticed when I went out that the light was
on.”[C4-132] Mrs. Paine was certain that she had not left the light on
in the garage after dinner.[C4-133] According to Mrs. Paine, Oswald
had gone to bed by 9 p.m.;[C4-134] Marina Oswald testified that it was
between 9 and 10 p.m.[C4-135] Neither Marina Oswald nor Ruth Paine
saw Oswald in the garage.[C4-136] The period between 8 and 9 p.m.,
however, provided ample opportunity for Oswald to prepare the rifle for
his departure the next morning. Only if disassembled could the rifle
fit into the paper bag found near the window[C4-137] from which the
shots were fired. A firearms expert with the FBI assembled the rifle
in 6 minutes using a 10-cent coin as a tool, and he could disassemble
it more rapidly.[C4-138] While the rifle may have already been
disassembled when Oswald arrived home on Thursday, he had ample time
that evening to disassemble the rifle and insert it into the paper bag.

On the day of the assassination, Marina Oswald was watching television
when she learned of the shooting. A short time later Mrs. Paine told
her that someone had shot the President “from the building in which
Lee is working.” Marina Oswald testified that at that time “My heart
dropped. I then went to the garage to see whether the rifle was there
and I saw that the blanket was still there and I said ‘Thank God.’” She
did not unroll the blanket. She saw that it was in its usual position
and it appeared to her to have something inside.[C4-139]

Soon afterward, at about 3 p.m., police officers arrived and searched
the house. Mrs. Paine pointed out that most of the Oswalds’ possessions
were in the garage.[C4-140] With Ruth Paine acting as an interpreter,
Detective Rose asked Marina whether her husband had a rifle. Mrs.
Paine, who had no knowledge of the rifle, first said “No,” but when
the question was translated, Marina Oswald replied “Yes.”[C4-141] She
pointed to the blanket which was on the floor very close to where Ruth
Paine was standing. Mrs. Paine testified:

    As she [Marina] told me about it I stepped onto the blanket
    roll. * * * And she indicated to me that she had peered into
    this roll and saw a portion of what she took to be a gun she
    knew her husband to have, a rifle. And I then translated this
    to the officers that she knew that her husband had a gun that
    he had stored in here. * * * I then stepped off of it and the
    officer picked it up in the middle and it bent so. * * *[C4-142]

Mrs. Paine had the actual blanket before her as she testified and she
indicated that the blanket hung limp in the officer’s hand.[C4-143]
Marina Oswald testified that this was her first knowledge that the
rifle was not in its accustomed place.[C4-144]


The Long and Bulky Package

On the morning of November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald left the Paine
house in Irving at approximately 7:15 a.m., while Marina Oswald was
still in bed.[C4-145] Neither she nor Mrs. Paine saw him leave the
house.[C4-146] About half-a-block away from the Paine house was the
residence of Mrs. Linnie Mae Randle, the sister of the man with whom
Oswald drove to work--Buell Wesley Frazier. Mrs. Randle stated that on
the morning of November 22, while her brother was eating breakfast, she
looked out the breakfast-room window and saw Oswald cross the street
and walk toward the driveway where her brother parked his car near
the carport. He carried a “heavy brown bag.”[C4-147] Oswald gripped
the bag in his right hand near the top. “It tapered like this as he
hugged it in his hand. It was * * * more bulky toward the bottom”
than toward the top.[C4-148] She then opened the kitchen door and
saw Oswald open the right rear door of her brother’s car and place
the package in the back of the car.[C4-149] Mrs. Randle estimated
that the package was approximately 28 inches long and about 8 inches
wide.[C4-150] She thought that its color was similar to that of the
bag found on the sixth floor of the School Book Depository after the
assassination.[C4-151]

Frazier met Oswald at the kitchen door and together they walked to the
car.[C4-152] After entering the car, Frazier glanced over his shoulder
and noticed a brown paper package on the back seat. He asked, “What’s
the package, Lee?” Oswald replied, “curtain rods.”[C4-153] Frazier told
the Commission “* * * the main reason he was going over there that
Thursday afternoon when he was to bring back some curtain rods, so I
didn’t think any more about it when he told me that.”[C4-154] Frazier
estimated that the bag was 2 feet long “give and take a few inches,”
and about 5 or 6 inches wide.[C4-155] As they sat in the car, Frazier
asked Oswald where his lunch was, and Oswald replied that he was going
to buy his lunch that day.[C4-156] Frazier testified that Oswald
carried no lunch bag that day. “When he rode with me, I say he always
brought lunch except that one day on November 22 he didn’t bring his
lunch that day.”[C4-157]

Frazier parked the car in the company parking lot about 2 blocks
north of the Depository Building. Oswald left the car first, picked
up the brown paper bag, and proceeded toward the building ahead of
Frazier. Frazier walked behind and as they crossed the railroad tracks
he watched the switching of the cars. Frazier recalled that one end
of the package was under Oswald’s armpit and the lower part was held
with his right hand so that it was carried straight and parallel
to his body. When Oswald entered the rear door of the Depository
Building, he was about 50 feet ahead of Frazier. It was the first time
that Oswald had not walked with Frazier from the parking lot to the
building entrance.[C4-158] When Frazier entered the building, he did
not see Oswald.[C4-159] One employee, Jack Dougherty, believed that he
saw Oswald coming to work, but he does not remember that Oswald had
anything in his hands as he entered the door.[C4-160] No other employee
has been found who saw Oswald enter that morning.[C4-161]

In deciding whether Oswald carried the assassination weapon in the
bag which Frazier and Mrs. Randle saw, the Commission has carefully
considered the testimony of these two witnesses with regard to the
length of the bag. Frazier and Mrs. Randle testified that the bag which
Oswald was carrying was approximately 27 or 28 inches long,[C4-162]
whereas the wooden stock of the rifle, which is its largest component,
measured 34.8 inches.[C4-163] The bag found on the sixth floor was 38
inches long.[C4-164] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, p. 132.) When
Frazier appeared before the Commission and was asked to demonstrate
how Oswald carried the package, he said, “Like I said, I remember
that I didn’t look at the package very much * * * but when I did
look at it he did have his hands on the package like that,”[C4-165]
and at this point Frazier placed the upper part of the package under
his armpit and attempted to cup his right hand beneath the bottom of
the bag. The disassembled rifle was too long to be carried in this
manner. Similarly, when the butt of the rifle was placed in Frazier’s
hand, it extended above his shoulder to ear level.[C4-166] Moreover,
in an interview on December 1, 1963, with agents of the FBI, Frazier
had marked the point on the back seat of his car which he believed
was where the bag reached when it was laid on the seat with one edge
against the door. The distance between the point on the seat and the
door was 27 inches.[C4-167]

Mrs. Randle said, when shown the paper bag, that the bag she saw Oswald
carrying “wasn’t that long, I mean it was folded down at the top as
I told you. It definitely wasn’t that long.”[C4-168] And she folded
the bag to a length of about 28½ inches. Frazier doubted whether the
bag that Oswald carried was as wide as the bag found on the sixth
floor,[C4-169] although Mrs. Randle testified that the width was
approximately the same.[C4-170]

The Commission has weighed the visual recollection of Frazier and
Mrs. Randle against the evidence here presented that the bag Oswald
carried contained the assassination weapon and has concluded that
Frazier and Randle are mistaken as to the length of the bag. Mrs.
Randle saw the bag fleetingly and her first remembrance is that it was
held in Oswald’s right hand “and it almost touched the ground as he
carried it.”[C4-171] Frazier’s view of the bag was from the rear. He
continually advised that he was not paying close attention.[C4-172] For
example, he said,

    * * * I didn’t pay too much attention the way he was walking
    because I was walking along there looking at the railroad cars
    and watching the men on the diesel switch them cars and I
    didn’t pay too much attention on how he carried the package at
    all.[C4-173]

Frazier could easily have been mistaken when he stated that Oswald held
the bottom of the bag cupped in his hand with the upper end tucked into
his armpit.


Location of Bag

A handmade bag of wrapping paper and tape[C4-174] was found in the
southeast corner of the sixth floor alongside the window from which the
shots were fired.[C4-175] (See Commission Exhibit No. 2707, p. 142.) It
was not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a store and it
was presumably made for a particular purpose. It was the appropriate
size to contain, in disassembled form, Oswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano
rifle, serial No. C2766, which was also found on the sixth
floor.[C4-176] Three cartons had been placed at the window apparently
to act as a gun rest and a fourth carton was placed behind those at the
window.[C4-177] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1301, p. 138.) A person
seated on the fourth carton could assemble the rifle without being seen
from the rest of the sixth floor because the cartons stacked around the
southeast corner would shield him.[C4-178] (See Commission Exhibit No.
723, p. 80.) The presence of the bag in this corner is cogent evidence
that it was used as the container for the rifle. At the time the bag
was found, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas police wrote on it, “Found next
to the sixth floor window gun fired from. May have been used to carry
gun. Lt. J. C. Day.”[C4-179]


Scientific Evidence Linking Rifle and Oswald to Paper Bag

_Oswald’s fingerprint and palmprint found on bag._--Using a standard
chemical method involving silver nitrates[C4-180] the FBI Laboratory
developed a latent palmprint and latent fingerprint on the bag.
(See app. X, p. 565.) Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the FBI’s
Latent Fingerprint Section, identified these prints as the left index
fingerprint and right palmprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-181] The
portion of the palm which was identified was the heel of the right
palm, i.e., the area near the wrist, on the little finger side.[C4-182]
These prints were examined independently by Ronald G. Wittmus of the
FBI,[C4-183] and by Arthur Mandella, a fingerprint expert with the New
York City Police Department.[C4-184] Both concluded that the prints
were the right palm and left index finger of Lee Oswald. No other
identifiable prints were found on the bag.[C4-185]

Oswald’s palmprint on the bottom of the paper bag indicated, of course,
that he had handled the bag. Furthermore, it was consistent with the
bag having contained a heavy or bulky object when he handled it since a
light object is usually held by the fingers.[C4-186] The palmprint was
found on the closed end of the bag. It was from Oswald’s right hand, in
which he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier’s car to
the building.[C4-187]

_Materials used to make bag._--On the day of the assassination, the
Dallas police obtained a sample of wrapping paper and tape from the
shipping room of the Depository and forwarded it to the FBI Laboratory
in Washington.[C4-188] James C. Cadigan, a questioned-documents expert
with the Bureau, compared the samples with the paper and tape in the
actual bag. He testified, “In all of the observations and physical
tests that I made I found * * * the bag * * * and the paper sample * *
* were the same.”[C4-189]

Among other tests, the paper and tape were submitted to fiber analysis
and spectrographic examination.[C4-190] In addition the tape was
compared to determine whether the sample tape and the tape on the bag
had been taken from the tape dispensing machine at the Depository.
When asked to explain the similarity of characteristics, Cadigan
stated:[C4-191]

    Well, briefly, it would be the thickness of both the paper and
    the tape, the color under various lighting conditions of both
    the paper and the tape, the width of the tape, the knurled
    markings on the surface of the fiber, the texture of the fiber,
    the felting pattern * * *

       *       *       *       *       *

    I found that the paper sack found on the sixth floor * * * and
    the sample * * * had the same observable characteristics both
    under the microscope and all the visual tests that I could
    conduct.

       *       *       *       *       *

    The papers I also found were similar in fiber composition,
    therefore, in addition to the visual characteristics,
    microscopic and UV [ultra violet] characteristics.

Mr. Cadigan concluded that the paper and tape from the bag were
identical in all respects to the sample paper and tape taken from the
Texas School Book Depository shipping room on November 22, 1963.[C4-192]

On December 1, 1963, a replica bag was made from materials found on
that date in the shipping room. This was done as an investigatory aid
since the original bag had been discolored during various laboratory
examinations and could not be used for valid identification by
witnesses.[C4-193] Cadigan found that the paper used to make this
replica sack had different characteristics from the paper in the
original bag.[C4-194] The science of paper analysis enabled him to
distinguish between different rolls of paper even though they were
produced by the same manufacturer.[C4-195]

Since the Depository normally used approximately one roll of paper
every 3 working days,[C4-196] it was not surprising that the replica
sack made on December 1, 1963, had different characteristics from
both the actual bag and the sample taken on November 22. On the other
hand, since two rolls could be made from the same batch of paper, one
cannot estimate when, prior to November 22, Oswald made the paper bag.
However, the complete identity of characteristics between the paper
and tape in the bag found on the sixth floor and the paper and tape
found in the shipping room of the Depository on November 22 enabled
the Commission to conclude that the bag was made from these materials.
The Depository shipping department was on the first floor to which
Oswald had access in the normal performance of his duties filling
orders.[C4-197]

_Fibers in paper bag matched fibers in blanket._--When Paul M.
Stombaugh of the FBI Laboratory examined the paper bag, he found,
on the inside, a single brown delustered viscose fiber and several
light green cotton fibers.[C4-198] The blanket in which the rifle was
stored was composed of brown and green cotton, viscose and woolen
fibers.[C4-199]

The single brown viscose fiber found in the bag matched some
of the brown viscose fibers from the blanket in all observable
characteristics.[C4-200] The green cotton fibers found in the paper
bag matched some of the green cotton fibers in the blanket “in all
observable microscopic characteristics.”[C4-201] Despite these matches,
however, Stombaugh was unable to render an opinion that the fibers
which he found in the bag had probably come from the blanket, because
other types of fibers present in the blanket were not found in the bag.
He concluded:

    All I would say here is that it is possible that these fibers
    could have come from this blanket, because this blanket is
    composed of brown and green woolen fibers, brown and green
    delustered viscose fibers, and brown and green cotton fibers. *
    * * We found no brown cotton fibers, no green viscose fibers,
    and no woolen fibers.

    So if I found all of these then I would have been able to say
    these fibers probably had come from this blanket. But since I
    found so few, then I would say the possibility exists, these
    fibers could have come from this blanket.[C4-202]

Stombaugh confirmed that the rifle could have picked up fibers from the
blanket and transferred them to the paper bag.[C4-203] In light of the
other evidence linking Lee Harvey Oswald, the blanket, and the rifle
to the paper bag found on the sixth floor, the Commission considered
Stombaugh’s testimony of probative value in deciding whether Oswald
carried the rifle into the building in the paper bag.


Conclusion

The preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that Lee
Harvey Oswald (1) told the curtain rod story to Frazier to explain both
the return to Irving on a Thursday and the obvious bulk of the package
which he intended to bring to work the next day; (2) took paper and
tape from the wrapping bench of the Depository and fashioned a bag
large enough to carry the disassembled rifle; (3) removed the rifle
from the blanket in the Paines’ garage on Thursday evening; (4) carried
the rifle into the Depository Building, concealed in the bag; and, (5)
left the bag alongside the window from which the shots were fired.


OSWALD AT WINDOW

Lee Harvey Oswald was hired on October 15, 1963, by the Texas School
Book Depository as an “order filler.”[C4-204] He worked principally
on the first and sixth floors of the building, gathering books listed
on orders and delivering them to the shipping room on the first
floor.[C4-205] He had ready access to the sixth floor,[C4-206] from
the southeast corner window of which the shots were fired.[C4-207]
The Commission evaluated the physical evidence found near the window
after the assassination and the testimony of eyewitnesses in deciding
whether Lee Harvey Oswald was present at this window at the time of the
assassination.

Palmprints and Fingerprints on Cartons and Paper Bag

Below the southeast corner window on the sixth floor was a large carton
of books measuring approximately 18 by 12 by 14 inches which had been
moved from a stack along the south wall.[C4-208] Atop this carton was
a small carton marked “Rolling Readers,” measuring approximately 13
by 9 by 8 inches.[C4-209] In front of this small carton and resting
partially on the windowsill was another small “Rolling Readers”
carton.[C4-210] These two small cartons had been moved from a stack
about three aisles away.[C4-211] The boxes in the window appeared to
have been arranged as a convenient gun rest.[C4-212] (See Commission
Exhibit No. 1301, p. 138.) Behind these boxes was another carton placed
on the floor on which a man sitting could look southwesterly down Elm
Street over the top of the “Rolling Readers” cartons.[C4-213] Next to
these cartons was the handmade paper bag, previously discussed, on
which appeared the print of the left index finger and right palm of Lee
Harvey Oswald.[C4-214] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1302, p. 139.)

The cartons were forwarded to the FBI in Washington. Sebastian F.
Latona, supervisor of the Latent Fingerprint Section, testified that
20 identifiable fingerprints and 8 palmprints were developed on these
cartons.[C4-215] The carton on the windowsill and the large carton
below the window contained no prints which could be identified as being
those of Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-216] The other “Rolling Readers” carton,
however, contained a palmprint and a fingerprint which were identified
by Latona as being the left palmprint and right index fingerprint of
Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-217] (See app. X, p. 566.)

The Commission has considered the possibility that the cartons might
have been moved in connection with the work that was being performed
on the sixth floor on November 22. Depository employees were laying
a new floor at the west end and transferring books from the west to
the east end of the building.[C4-218] The “Rolling Readers” cartons,
however, had not been moved by the floor layers and had apparently been
taken to the window from their regular position for some particular
purpose.[C4-219] The “Rolling Readers” boxes contained, instead of
books, light blocks used as reading aids.[C4-220] They could be easily
adjusted and were still solid enough to serve as a gun rest.

The box on the floor, behind the three near the window, had been
one of these moved by the floor layers from the west wall to near
the east side of the building in preparation for the laying of the
floor.[C4-221] During the afternoon of November 22, Lieutenant Day
of the Dallas police dusted this carton with powder and developed
a palmprint on the top edge of the carton on the side nearest the
window.[C4-222] The position of this palmprint on the carton was
parallel with the long axis of the box, and at right angles with the
short axis; the bottom of the palm rested on the box.[C4-223] Someone
sitting on the box facing the window would have his palm in this
position if he placed his hand alongside his right hip. (See Commission
Exhibit No. 1302, p. 139.) This print which had been cut out of the
box was also forwarded to the FBI and Latona identified it as Oswald’s
right palmprint.[C4-224] In Latona’s opinion “not too long” a time
had elapsed between the time that the print was placed on the carton
and the time that it had been developed by the Dallas police.[C4-225]
Although Bureau experiments had shown that 24 hours was a likely
maximum time, Latona stated that he could only testify with certainty
that the print was less than 3 days old.[C4-226]

The print, therefore, could have been placed on the carton at any time
within this period. The freshness of this print could be estimated
only because the Dallas police developed it through the use of powder.
Since cartons absorb perspiration, powder can successfully develop a
print on such material[C4-227] only within a limited time. When the FBI
in Washington received the cartons, the remaining prints, including
Oswald’s on the Rolling Readers carton, were developed by chemical
processes. The freshness of prints developed in this manner[C4-228]
cannot be estimated, so no conclusions can be drawn as to whether these
remaining prints preceded or followed the print developed in Dallas
by powder. Most of the prints were found to have been placed on the
cartons by an FBI clerk and a Dallas police officer after the cartons
had been processed with powder by the Dallas Police.[C4-229] (See ch.
VI, p. 249; app. X, p. 566.)

In his independent investigation, Arthur Mandella of the New York
City Police Department reached the same conclusion as Latona that the
prints found on the cartons were those of Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-229]
In addition, Mandella was of the opinion that the print taken from the
carton on the floor was probably made within a day or a day and a half
of the examination on November 22.[C4-230] Moreover, another expert
with the FBI, Ronald G. Wittmus, conducted a separate examination and
also agreed with Latona that the prints were Oswald’s.[C4-231]

In evaluating the significance of these fingerprint and palmprint
identifications, the Commission considered the possibility that Oswald
handled these cartons as part of his normal duties. Since other
identifiable prints were developed on the cartons, the Commission
requested that they be compared with the prints of the 12 warehouse
employees who, like Oswald, might have handled the cartons. They were
also compared with the prints of those law enforcement officials who
might have handled the cartons. The results of this investigation are
fully discussed in chapter VI, page 249. Although a person could handle
a carton and not leave identifiable prints, none of these employees
except Oswald left identifiable prints on the cartons.[C4-232] This
finding, in addition to the freshness of one of the prints and the
presence of Oswald’s prints on two of the four cartons and the
paper bag led the Commission to attach some probative value to the
fingerprint and palmprint identifications in reaching the conclusion
that Oswald was at the window from which the shots were fired, although
the prints do not establish the exact time he was there.

SIXTH FLOOR, TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY DALLAS, TEXAS]


Oswald’s Presence on Sixth Floor Approximately 35 Minutes Before the
Assassination

Additional testimony linking Oswald with the point from which the
shots were fired was provided by the testimony of Charles Givens, who
was the last known employee to see Oswald inside the building prior
to the assassination. During the morning of November 22, Givens was
working with the floor-laying crew in the southwest section of the
sixth floor.[C4-233] At about 11:45 a.m. the floor-laying crew used
both elevators to come down from the sixth floor. The employees raced
the elevators to the first floor.[C4-234] Givens saw Oswald standing
at the gate on the fifth floor as the elevator went by.[C4-235] Givens
testified that after reaching the first floor, “I discovered I left
my cigarettes in my jacket pocket upstairs, and I took the elevator
back upstairs to get my jacket with my cigarettes in it.”[C4-236] He
saw Oswald, a clipboard in hand, walking from the southeast corner
of the sixth floor toward the elevator.[C4-237] (See Commission
Exhibit No. 2707, p. 142.) Givens said to Oswald, “Boy are you going
downstairs? * * * It’s near lunch time.” Oswald said, “No, sir. When
you get downstairs, close the gate to the elevator.”[C4-238] Oswald was
referring to the west elevator which operates by pushbutton and only
with the gate closed.[C4-239] Givens said, “Okay,” and rode down in the
east elevator. When he reached the first floor, the west elevator--the
one with the gate--was not there. Givens thought this was about 11:55
a.m.[C4-240] None of the Depository employees is known to have seen
Oswald again until after the shooting.[C4-241]

The significance of Givens’ observation that Oswald was carrying his
clipboard became apparent on December 2, 1963, when an employee,
Frankie Kaiser, found a clipboard hidden by book cartons in the
northwest corner of the sixth floor at the west wall a few feet from
where the rifle had been found.[C4-242] This clipboard had been made
by Kaiser and had his name on it.[C4-243] Kaiser identified it as the
clipboard which Oswald had appropriated from him when Oswald came to
work at the Depository.[C4-244] Three invoices on this clipboard,
each dated November 22, were for Scott-Foresman books, located on the
first and sixth floors.[C4-245] Oswald had not filled any of the three
orders.[C4-246]


Eyewitness Identification of Assassin

Howard L. Brennan was an eyewitness to the shooting. As indicated
previously the Commission considered his testimony as probative in
reaching the conclusion that the shots came from the sixth floor,
southeast corner window of the Depository Building.[C4-247] (See ch.
III, pp. 61-68.) Brennan also testified that Lee Harvey Oswald, whom
he viewed in a police lineup on the night of the assassination, was
the man he saw fire the shots from the sixth-floor window of the
Depository Building.[C4-248] When the shots were fired, Brennan was in
an excellent position to observe anyone in the window. He was sitting
on a concrete wall on the southwest corner of Elm and Houston Streets,
looking north at the Depository Building which was directly in front of
him.[C4-249] The window was approximately 120 feet away.[C4-250](See
Commission Exhibit No. 477, p. 62.)

In the 6- to 8-minute period before the motorcade arrived,[C4-251]
Brennan saw a man leave and return to the window “a couple of
times.”[C4-252] After hearing the first shot, which he thought was a
motorcycle backfire, Brennan glanced up at the window. He testified
that “this man I saw previously was aiming for his last shot * * *
as it appeared to me he was standing up and resting against the left
window sill * * *.”[C4-253]

Brennan saw the man fire the last shot and disappear from the window.
Within minutes of the assassination, Brennan described the man to the
police.[C4-254] This description most probably led to the radio alert
sent to police cars at approximately 12:45 p.m., which described the
suspect as white, slender, weighing about 165 pounds, about 5’10” tall,
and in his early thirties.[C4-255] In his sworn statement to the police
later that day, Brennan described the man in similar terms, except
that he gave the weight as between 165 and 175 pounds and the height
was omitted.[C4-256] In his testimony before the Commission, Brennan
described the person he saw as “* * * a man in his early thirties,
fair complexion, slender, but neat, neat slender, possible 5 foot 10 *
* * 160 to 170 pounds.”[C4-257] Oswald was 5’9”, slender and 24 years
old. When arrested, he gave his weight as 140 pounds.[C4-258] On other
occasions he gave weights of both 140 and 150 pounds.[C4-259] The New
Orleans police records of his arrest in August of 1963 show a weight of
136 pounds.[C4-260] The autopsy report indicated an estimated weight of
150 pounds.[C4-261]

Brennan’s description should also be compared with the eyewitness
description broadcast over the Dallas police radio at 1:22 p.m. of the
man who shot Patrolman J. D. Tippit. The suspect was described as “a
white male about 30, 5’8”, black hair, slender. * * *”[C4-262] At 1:29
p.m. the police radio reported that the description of the suspect in
the Tippit shooting was similar to the description which had been given
by Brennan in connection with the assassination.[C4-263] Approximately
7 or 8 minutes later the police radio reported that “an eyeball
witness” described the suspect in the Tippit shooting as “a white male,
27, 5’11”, 165 pounds, black wavy hair.”[C4-264] As will be discussed
fully below, the Commission has concluded that this suspect was Lee
Harvey Oswald.

Although Brennan testified that the man in the window was standing
when he fired the shots,[C4-265] most probably he was either sitting
or kneeling. The half-open window,[C4-266] the arrangement of the
boxes,[C4-267] and the angle of the shots virtually preclude a standing
position.[C4-268] It is understandable, however, for Brennan to have
believed that the man with the rifle was standing. A photograph
of the building taken seconds after the assassination shows three
employees looking out of the fifth-floor window directly below the
window from which the shots were fired. Brennan testified that
they were standing,[C4-269] which is their apparent position in the
photograph.[C4-270] (See Dillard Exhibits Nos. C and D. pp. 66-67.) But
the testimony of these employees,[C4-271] together with photographs
subsequently taken of them at the scene of the assassination,[C4-272]
establishes that they were either squatting or kneeling. (See
Commission Exhibit No. 485, p. 69.) Since the window ledges in the
Depository Building are lower than in most buildings,[C4-273] a person
squatting or kneeling exposes more of his body than would normally be
the case. From the street, this creates the impression that the person
is standing. Brennan could have seen enough of the body of a kneeling
or squatting person to estimate his height.

Shortly after the assassination Brennan noticed two of these employees
leaving the building and immediately identified them as having been
in the fifth-floor windows.[C4-274] When the three employees appeared
before the Commission, Brennan identified the two whom he saw leave the
building.[C4-275] The two men, Harold Norman and James Jarman, Jr.,
each confirmed that when they came out of the building, they saw and
heard Brennan describing what he had seen.[C4-276] Norman stated, “*
* * I remember him talking and I believe I remember seeing him saying
that he saw us when we first went up to the fifth-floor window, he saw
us then.”[C4-277] Jarman heard Brennan “talking to this officer about
that he had heard these shots and he had seen the barrel of the gun
sticking out the window, and he said that the shots came from inside
the building.”[C4-278]

During the evening of November 22, Brennan identified Oswald as
the person in the lineup who bore the closest resemblance to the
man in the window but he said he was unable to make a positive
identification.[C4-279] Prior to the lineup, Brennan had seen Oswald’s
picture on television and he told the Commission that whether this
affected his identification “is something I do not know.”[C4-280] In
an interview with FBI agents on December 17, 1963, Brennan stated
that he was sure that the person firing the rifle was Oswald.[C4-281]
In another interview with FBI agents on January 7, 1964, Brennan
appeared to revert to his earlier inability to make a positive
identification,[C4-282] but, in his testimony before the Commission,
Brennan stated that his remarks of January 7 were intended by him
merely as an accurate report of what he said on November 22.[C4-283]

Brennan told the Commission that he could have made a positive
identification in the lineup on November 22 but did not do so because
he felt that the assassination was “a Communist activity, and I felt
like there hadn’t been more than one eyewitness, and if it got to be a
known fact that I was an eyewitness, my family or I, either one, might
not be safe.”[C4-284] When specifically asked before the Commission
whether or not he could positively identify the man he saw in the
sixth-floor window as the same man he saw in the police station,
Brennan stated, “I could at that time--I could, with all sincerity,
identify him as being the same man.”[C4-285]

Although the record indicates that Brennan was an accurate observer,
he declined to make a positive identification of Oswald when he first
saw him in the police lineup.[C4-286] The Commission, therefore, does
not base its conclusion concerning the identity of the assassin on
Brennan’s subsequent certain identification of Lee Harvey Oswald as
the man he saw fire the rifle. Immediately after the assassination,
however, Brennan described to the police the man he saw in the window
and then identified Oswald as the person who most nearly resembled the
man he saw. The Commission is satisfied that, at the least, Brennan saw
a man in the window who closely resembled Lee Harvey Oswald, and that
Brennan believes the man he saw was in fact Lee Harvey Oswald.

Two other witnesses were able to offer partial descriptions of a
man they saw in the southeast corner window of the sixth floor
approximately 1 minute before the assassination, although neither
witness saw the shots being fired.[C4-287] Ronald Fischer and Robert
Edwards were standing on the curb at the southwest corner of Elm and
Houston Streets,[C4-288] the same corner where Brennan was sitting on
a concrete wall.[C4-289] Fischer testified that about 10 or 15 seconds
before the motorcade turned onto Houston Street from Main Street,
Edwards said, “Look at that guy there in that window.”[C4-290]

Fischer looked up and watched the man in the window for 10 or 15
seconds and then started watching the motorcade, which came into view
on Houston Street.[C4-291] He said that the man held his attention
until the motorcade came because the man:

    * * * appeared uncomfortable for one, and secondly, he wasn’t
    watching * * * he didn’t look like he was watching for the
    parade. He looked like he was looking down toward the Trinity
    River and the Triple Underpass down at the end--toward the end
    of Elm Street. And * * * all the time I watched him, he never
    moved his head, he never--he never moved anything. Just was
    there transfixed.[C4-292]

Fischer placed the man in the easternmost window on the south side of
the Depository Building on either the fifth or the sixth floor.[C4-293]
He said that he could see the man from the middle of his chest to the
top of his head, and that as he was facing the window the man was in
the lower right-hand portion of the window and “seemed to be sitting
a little forward.”[C4-294] The man was dressed in a light-colored,
open-neck shirt which could have been either a sports shirt or a
T-shirt, and he had brown hair, a slender face and neck with light
complexion, and looked to be 22 or 24 years old.[C4-295] The person
in the window was a white man and “looked to me like he was looking
straight at the Triple Underpass” down Elm Street.[C4-296] Boxes and
cases were stacked behind him.[C4-297]

Approximately 1 week after the assassination, according to Fischer,
policemen showed him a picture of Oswald.[C4-298] In his testimony
he said, “I told them that that could have been the man. * * * That
that could have been the man that I saw in the window in the School
Book Depository Building, but that I was not sure.”[C4-299] Fischer
described the man’s hair as some shade of brown--“it wasn’t dark and it
wasn’t light.”[C4-300] On November 22, Fischer had apparently described
the man as “light-headed.”[C4-301] Fischer explained that he did not
mean by the earlier statement that the man was blond, but rather that
his hair was not black.[C4-302]

Robert Edwards said that, while looking at the south side of the
Depository Building shortly before the motorcade, he saw nothing of
importance “except maybe one individual who was up there in the corner
room of the sixth floor which was crowded in among boxes.”[C4-303] He
said that this was a white man about average in size, “possibly thin,”
and that he thought the man had light-brown hair.[C4-304] Fischer and
Edwards did not see the man clearly enough or long enough to identify
him. Their testimony is of probative value, however, because their
limited description is consistent with that of the man who has been
found by the Commission, based on other evidence, to have fired the
shots from the window.

Another person who saw the assassin as the shots were fired was Amos L.
Euins, age 15, who was one of the first witnesses to alert the police
to the Depository as the source of the shots, as has been discussed in
chapter III.[C4-305] Euins, who was on the southwest corner of Elm and
Houston Streets,[C4-306] testified that he could not describe the man
he saw in the window. According to Euins, however, as the man lowered
his head in order to aim the rifle down Elm Street, he appeared to have
a white bald spot on his head.[C4-307] Shortly after the assassination,
Euins signed an affidavit describing the man as “white,”[C4-308] but
a radio reporter testified that Euins described the man to him as
“colored.”[C4-309] In his Commission testimony, Euins stated that
he could not ascertain the man’s race and that the statement in the
affidavit was intended to refer only to the white spot on the man’s
head and not to his race.[C4-310] A Secret Service agent who spoke to
Euins approximately 20 to 30 minutes after the assassination confirmed
that Euins could neither describe the man in the window nor indicate
his race.[C4-311] Accordingly, Euins’ testimony is considered probative
as to the source of the shots but is inconclusive as to the identity of
the man in the window.

In evaluating the evidence that Oswald was at the southeast corner
window of the sixth floor at the time of the shooting, the Commission
has considered the allegation that Oswald was photographed standing in
front of the building when the shots were fired. The picture which gave
rise to these allegations was taken by Associated Press Photographer
James W. Altgens, who was standing on the south side of Elm Street
between the Triple Underpass and the Depository Building.[C4-312] As
the motorcade started its descent down Elm Street, Altgens snapped
a picture of the Presidential limousine with the entrance to the
Depository Building in the background.[C4-313] Just before snapping
the picture Altgens heard a noise which sounded like the popping of
a firecracker. Investigation has established that Altgens’ picture
was taken approximately 2 seconds after the firing of the shot which
entered the back of the President’s neck.[C4-314]

In the background of this picture were several employees watching
the parade from the steps of the Depository Building. One of these
employees was alleged to resemble Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-315] The
Commission has determined that the employee was in fact Billy
Nolan Lovelady, who identified himself in the picture.[C4-316]
Standing alongside him were Buell Wesley Frazier[C4-317] and William
Shelley,[C4-318] who also identified Lovelady. The Commission is
satisfied that Oswald does not appear in this photograph. (See
Commission Exhibit No. 900, p. 113.)


Oswald’s Actions in Building After Assassination

In considering whether Oswald was at the southeast corner window at the
time the shots were fired, the Commission has reviewed the testimony
of witnesses who saw Oswald in the building within minutes after the
assassination. The Commission has found that Oswald’s movements, as
described by these witnesses, are consistent with his having been at
the window at 12:30 p.m.

_The encounter in the lunchroom._--The first person to see Oswald
after the assassination was Patrolman M. L. Baker of the Dallas Police
Department. Baker was riding a two-wheeled motorcycle behind the last
press car of the motorcade.[C4-319] As he turned the corner from Main
onto Houston at a speed of about 5 to 10 miles per hour,[C4-320] a
strong wind blowing from the north almost unseated him.[C4-321] At
about this time he heard the first shot.[C4-322] Having recently
heard the sounds of rifles while on a hunting trip, Baker recognized
the shots as that of a high-powered rifle; “it sounded high and I
immediately kind of looked up, and I had a feeling that it came from
the building, either right in front of me [the Depository Building]
or of the one across to the right of it.”[C4-323] He saw pigeons
flutter upward. He was not certain, “but I am pretty sure they came
from the building right on the northwest corner.”[C4-324] He heard two
more shots spaced “pretty well even to me.”[C4-325] After the third
shot, he “revved that motorcycle up,” drove to the northwest corner
of Elm and Houston, and parked approximately 10 feet from the traffic
signal.[C4-326] As he was parking he noted that people were “falling,
and they were rolling around down there * * * grabbing their children”
and rushing about.[C4-327] A woman screamed, “Oh, they have shot that
man, they have shot that man.”[C4-328] Baker “had it in mind that the
shots came from the top of this building here,” so he ran straight to
the entrance of the Depository Building.[C4-329]

Baker testified that he entered the lobby of the building and “spoke
out and asked where the stairs or elevator was * * * and this man,
Mr. Truly, spoke up and says, it seems to me like he says, ‘I am a
building manager. Follow me, officer, and I will show you.’”[C4-330]
Baker and building superintendent Roy Truly went through a second set
of doors[C4-331] and stopped at a swinging door where Baker bumped into
Truly’s back.[C4-332] They went through the swinging door and continued
at “a good trot” to the northwest corner of the floor where Truly hoped
to find one of the two freight elevators. (See Commission Exhibit No.
1061, p. 148.) Neither elevator was there.[C4-333] Truly pushed the
button for the west elevator which operates automatically if the gate
is closed.[C4-334] He shouted twice, “Turn loose the elevator.”[C4-335]
When the elevator failed to come, Baker said, “let’s take the stairs,”
and he followed Truly up the stairway, which is to the west of the
elevator.[C4-336]

[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1118

TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY DIAGRAM OF SECOND FLOOR SHOWING ROUTE OF
OSWALD]

The stairway is located in the northwest corner of the Depository
Building. The stairs from one floor to the next are “=L=-shaped,”
with both legs of the “=L=” approximately the same length. Because
the stairway itself is enclosed, neither Baker nor Truly could see
anything on the second-floor hallway until they reached the landing at
the top of the stairs.[C4-337] On the second-floor landing there is a
small open area with a door at the east end. This door leads into a
small vestibule, and another door leads from the vestibule into the
second-floor lunchroom.[C4-338] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1118, p.
150.) The lunchroom door is usually open, but the first door is kept
shut by a closing mechanism on the door.[C4-339] This vestibule door
is solid except for a small glass window in the upper part of the
door.[C4-340] As Baker reached the second floor, he was about 20 feet
from the vestibule door.[C4-341] He intended to continue around to his
left toward the stairway going up but through the window in the door he
caught a fleeting glimpse of a man walking in the vestibule toward the
lunchroom.[C4-342]

Since the vestibule door is only a few feet from the lunchroom
door,[C4-343] the man must have entered the vestibule only a second
or two before Baker arrived at the top of the stairwell. Yet he must
have entered the vestibule door before Truly reached the top of the
stairwell, since Truly did not see him.[C4-344] If the man had passed
from the vestibule into the lunchroom, Baker could not have seen him.
Baker said:

    He [Truly] had already started around the bend to come to the
    next elevator going up, I was coming out this one on the second
    floor, and I don’t know, I was kind of sweeping this area as I
    come up, I was looking from right to left and as I got to this
    door here I caught a glimpse of this man, just, you know, a
    sudden glimpse * * * and it looked to me like he was going away
    from me. * * *

    I can’t say whether he had gone on through that door [the
    lunchroom door] or not. All I did was catch a glance at him,
    and evidently he was--this door might have been, you know,
    closing and almost shut at that time.[C4-345]

With his revolver drawn, Baker opened the vestibule door and ran into
the vestibule. He saw a man walking away from him in the lunchroom.
Baker stopped at the door of the lunchroom and commanded, “Come
here.”[C4-346] The man turned and walked back toward Baker.[C4-347] He
had been proceeding toward the rear of the lunchroom.[C4-348] Along a
side wall of the lunchroom was a soft drink vending machine,[C4-349]
but at that time the man had nothing in his hands.[C4-350]

Meanwhile, Truly had run up several steps toward the third floor.
Missing Baker, he came back to find the officer in the doorway to the
lunchroom “facing Lee Harvey Oswald.”[C4-351] Baker turned to Truly
and said, “Do you know this man, does he work here?”[C4-352] Truly
replied, “Yes.”[C4-353] Baker stated later that the man did not seem to
be out of breath; he seemed calm. “He never did say a word or nothing.
In fact, he didn’t change his expression one bit.”[C4-354] Truly said
of Oswald: “He didn’t seem to be excited or overly afraid or anything.
He might have been a bit startled, like I might have been if somebody
confronted me. But I cannot recall any change in expression of any kind
on his face.”[C4-355] Truly thought that the officer’s gun at that time
appeared to be almost touching the middle portion of Oswald’s body.
Truly also noted at this time that Oswald’s hands were empty.[C4-356]

In an effort to determine whether Oswald could have descended to the
lunchroom from the sixth floor by the time Baker and Truly arrived,
Commission counsel asked Baker and Truly to repeat their movements from
the time of the shot until Baker came upon Oswald in the lunchroom.
Baker placed himself on a motorcycle about 200 feet from the corner
of Elm and Houston Streets where he said he heard the shots.[C4-357]
Truly stood in front of the building.[C4-358] At a given signal, they
reenacted the event. Baker’s movements were timed with a stopwatch. On
the first test, the elapsed time between the simulated first shot and
Baker’s arrival on the second-floor stair landing was 1 minute and 30
seconds. The second test run required 1 minute and 15 seconds.[C4-359]

A test was also conducted to determine the time required to walk from
the southeast corner of the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom
by stairway. Special Agent John Howlett of the Secret Service carried
a rifle from the southeast corner of the sixth floor along the east
aisle to the northeast corner. He placed the rifle on the floor near
the site where Oswald’s rifle was actually found after the shooting.
Then Howlett walked down the stairway to the second-floor landing and
entered the lunchroom. The first test, run at normal walking pace,
required 1 minute, 18 seconds;[C4-360] the second test, at a “fast
walk” took 1 minute, 14 seconds.[C4-361] The second test followed
immediately after the first. The only interval was the time necessary
to ride in the elevator from the second to the sixth floor and walk
back to the southeast corner. Howlett was not short winded at the end
of either test run.[C4-362]

The minimum time required by Baker to park his motorcycle and reach
the second-floor lunchroom was within 3 seconds of the time needed to
walk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down the stairway to
the lunchroom. The time actually required for Baker and Truly to reach
the second floor on November 22 was probably longer than in the test
runs. For example, Baker required 15 seconds after the simulated shot
to ride his motorcycle 180 to 200 feet, park it, and run 45 feet to the
building.[C4-363] No allowance was made for the special conditions
which existed on the day of the assassination--possible delayed
reaction to the shot, jostling with the crowd of people on the steps
and scanning the area along Elm Street and the parkway.[C4-364] Baker
said, “We simulated the shots and by the time we got there, we did
everything that I did that day, and this would be the minimum, because
I am sure that I, you know, it took me a little longer.”[C4-365] On
the basis of this time test, therefore, the Commission concluded that
Oswald could have fired the shots and still have been present in the
second-floor lunchroom when seen by Baker and Truly.

That Oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the
second-floor lunchroom is consistent with the movements of the two
elevators, which would have provided the other possible means of
descent. When Truly, accompanied by Baker, ran to the rear of the
first floor, he was certain that both elevators, which occupy the same
shaft,[C4-366] were on the fifth floor.[C4-367] Baker, not realizing
that there were two elevators, thought that only one elevator was
in the shaft and that it was two or three floors above the second
floor.[C4-368] In the few seconds which elapsed while Baker and Truly
ran from the first to the second floor, neither of these slow elevators
could have descended from the fifth to the second floor. Furthermore,
no elevator was at the second floor when they arrived there.[C4-369]
Truly and Baker continued up the stairs after the encounter with Oswald
in the lunchroom. There was no elevator on the third or fourth floor.
The east elevator was on the fifth floor when they arrived; the west
elevator was not. They took the east elevator to the seventh floor
and ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several
minutes.[C4-370]

Jack Dougherty, an employee working on the fifth floor, testified
that he took the west elevator to the first floor after hearing a
noise which sounded like a backfire.[C4-371] Eddie Piper, the janitor,
told Dougherty that the President had been shot,[C4-372] but in his
testimony Piper did not mention either seeing or talking with Dougherty
during these moments of excitement.[C4-373] Both Dougherty and Piper
were confused witnesses. They had no exact memory of the events of that
afternoon. Truly was probably correct in stating that the west elevator
was on the fifth floor when he looked up the elevator shaft from the
first floor. The west elevator was not on the fifth floor when Baker
and Truly reached that floor, probably because Jack Dougherty took it
to the first floor while Baker and Truly were running up the stairs or
in the lunchroom with Oswald. Neither elevator could have been used by
Oswald as a means of descent.

Oswald’s use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other
employees in the building. Three employees--James Jarman, Jr., Harold
Norman, and Bonnie Ray Williams--were watching the parade from the
fifth floor, directly below the window from which the shots were fired.
They rushed to the west windows after the shots were fired and remained
there until after they saw Patrolman Baker’s white helmet on the fifth
floor moving toward the elevator.[C4-374] While they were at the west
windows their view of the stairwell was completely blocked by shelves
and boxes.[C4-375] This is the period during which Oswald would have
descended the stairs. In all likelihood Dougherty took the elevator
down from the fifth floor after Jarman, Norman, and Williams ran to the
west windows and were deciding what to do. None of these three men saw
Dougherty, probably because of the anxiety of the moment and because
of the books which may have blocked the view.[C4-376] Neither Jarman,
Norman, Williams, or Dougherty saw Oswald.[C4-377]

Victoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository
Building, claimed that within about 1 minute following the shots she
ran from a window on the south side of the fourth floor,[C4-378]
down the rear stairs to the first floor, where she encountered two
Depository employees--William Shelley and Billy Lovelady.[C4-379] If
her estimate of time is correct, she reached the bottom of the stairs
before Truly and Baker started up, and she must have run down the
stairs ahead of Oswald and would probably have seen or heard him.
Actually she noticed no one on the back stairs. If she descended from
the fourth to the first floor as fast as she claimed in her testimony,
she would have seen Baker or Truly on the first floor or on the stairs,
unless they were already in the second-floor lunchroom talking to
Oswald. When she reached the first floor, she actually saw Shelley and
Lovelady slightly east of the east elevator.

Shelley and Lovelady, however, have testified that they were watching
the parade from the top step of the building entrance when Gloria
Calverly, who works in the Depository Building, ran up and said that
the President had been shot.[C4-380] Lovelady and Shelley moved
out into the street.[C4-381] About this time Shelley saw Truly and
Patrolman Baker go into the building.[C4-382] Shelley and Lovelady, at
a fast walk or trot, turned west into the railroad yards and then to
the west side of the Depository Building. They reentered the building
by the rear door several minutes after Baker and Truly rushed through
the front entrance.[C4-383] On entering, Lovelady saw a girl on the
first floor who he believes was Victoria Adams.[C4-384] If Miss Adams
accurately recalled meeting Shelley and Lovelady when she reached the
bottom of the stairs, then her estimate of the time when she descended
from the fourth floor is incorrect, and she actually came down the
stairs several minutes after Oswald and after Truly and Baker as well.

_Oswald’s departure from building._--Within a minute after Baker
and Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R. A. Reid, clerical
supervisor for the Texas School Book Depository, saw him walk through
the clerical office on the second floor toward the door leading to the
front stairway. Mrs. Reid had watched the parade from the sidewalk in
front of the building with Truly and Mr. O. V. Campbell, vice president
of the Depository.[C4-385] She testified that she heard three shots
which she thought came from the building.[C4-386] She ran inside and
up the front stairs into the large open office reserved for clerical
employees. As she approached her desk, she saw Oswald.[C4-387] He
was walking into the office from the back hallway, carrying a full
bottle of Coca-Cola in his hand,[C4-388] presumably purchased after
the encounter with Baker and Truly. As Oswald passed Mrs. Reid she
said, “Oh, the President has been shot, but maybe they didn’t hit
him.”[C4-389] Oswald mumbled something and walked by.[C4-390] She
paid no more attention to him. The only exit from the office in
the direction Oswald was moving was through the door to the front
stairway.[C4-391] (See Commission Exhibit 1118, p. 150.) Mrs. Reid
testified that when she saw Oswald, he was wearing a T-shirt and no
jacket.[C4-392] When he left home that morning, Marina Oswald, who
was still in bed, suggested that he wear a jacket.[C4-393] A blue
jacket, later identified by Marina Oswald as her husband’s,[C4-394] was
subsequently found in the building,[C4-395] apparently left behind by
Oswald.

Mrs. Reid believes that she returned to her desk from the street about
2 minutes after the shooting.[C4-396] Reconstructing her movements,
Mrs. Reid ran the distance three times and was timed in 2 minutes by
stopwatch.[C4-397] The reconstruction was the minimum time.[C4-398]
Accordingly, she probably met Oswald at about 12:32, approximately
30-45 seconds after Oswald’s lunchroom encounter with Baker and Truly.
After leaving Mrs. Reid in the front office, Oswald could have gone
down the stairs and out the front door by 12:33 p.m.[C4-399]--3 minutes
after the shooting. At that time the building had not yet been sealed
off by the police.

While it was difficult to determine exactly when the police sealed off
the building, the earliest estimates would still have permitted Oswald
to leave the building by 12:33. One of the police officers assigned to
the corner of Elm and Houston Streets for the Presidential motorcade,
W.E. Barnett, testified that immediately after the shots he went to
the rear of the building to check the fire escape. He then returned to
the corner of Elm and Houston where he met a sergeant who instructed
him to find out the name of the building. Barnett ran to the building,
noted its name, and then returned to the corner.[C4-400] There he was
met by a construction worker--in all likelihood Howard Brennan, who
was wearing his work helmet.[C4-401] This worker told Barnett that
the shots had been fired from a window in the Depository Building,
whereupon Barnett posted himself at the front door to make certain that
no one left the building. The sergeant did the same thing at the rear
of the building.[C4-402] Barnett estimated that approximately 3 minutes
elapsed between the time he heard the last of the shots and the time
he started guarding the front door. According to Barnett, “there were
people going in and out” during this period.[C4-403]

Sgt. D. V. Harkness of the Dallas police said that to his knowledge
the building was not sealed off at 12:36 p.m. when he called in on
police radio that a witness (Amos Euins) had seen shots fired from a
window of the building.[C4-404] At that time, Inspector Herbert V.
Sawyer’s car was parked in front of the building.[C4-405] Harkness did
not know whether or not two officers with Sawyer were guarding the
doors.[C4-406] At 12:34 p.m. Sawyer heard a call over the police radio
that the shots had come from the Depository Building.[C4-407] He then
entered the building and took the front passenger elevator as far as
it would go--the fourth floor.[C4-408] After inspecting this floor,
Sawyer returned to the street about 3 minutes after he entered the
building.[C4-409] After he returned to the street he directed Sergeant
Harkness to station two patrolmen at the front door and not let anyone
in or out; he also directed that the back door be sealed off.[C4-410]
This was no earlier than 12:37 p.m.[C4-411] and may have been later.
Special Agent Forrest V. Sorrels of the Secret Service, who had been
in the motorcade, testified that after driving to Parkland Hospital,
he returned to the Depository Building about 20 minutes after the
shooting, found no police officers at the rear door and was able to
enter through this door without identifying himself.[C4-412]

Although Oswald probably left the building at about 12:33 p.m., his
absence was not noticed until at least one-half hour later. Truly,
who had returned with Patrolman Baker from the roof, saw the police
questioning the warehouse employees. Approximately 15 men worked in the
warehouse[C4-413] and Truly noticed that Oswald was not among those
being questioned.[C4-414] Satisfying himself that Oswald was missing,
Truly obtained Oswald’s address, phone number, and description from
his employment application card. The address listed was for the Paine
home in Irving. Truly gave this information to Captain Fritz who was on
the sixth floor at the time[C4-415]. Truly estimated that he gave this
information to Fritz about 15 or 20 minutes after the shots,[C4-416]
but it was probably no earlier than 1:22 p.m., the time when the rifle
was found. Fritz believed that he learned of Oswald’s absence after
the rifle was found.[C4-417] The fact that Truly found Fritz in the
northwest corner of the floor, near the point where the rifle was
found, supports Fritz’ recollection.


Conclusion

Fingerprint and palmprint evidence establishes that Oswald handled
two of the four cartons next to the window and also handled a paper
bag which was found near the cartons. Oswald was seen in the vicinity
of the southeast corner of the sixth floor approximately 35 minutes
before the assassination and no one could be found who saw Oswald
anywhere else in the building until after the shooting. An eyewitness
to the shooting immediately provided a description of the man in the
window which was similar to Oswald’s actual appearance. This witness
identified Oswald in a lineup as the man most nearly resembling the man
he saw and later identified Oswald as the man he observed. Oswald’s
known actions in the building immediately after the assassination are
consistent with his having been at the southeast corner window of the
sixth floor at 12:30 p.m. On the basis of these findings the Commission
has concluded that Oswald, at the time of the assassination, was
present at the window from which the shots were fired.


THE KILLING OF PATROLMAN J. D. TIPPIT

After leaving the Depository Building at approximately 12:33 p.m.,
Lee Harvey Oswald proceeded to his roominghouse by bus and taxi. He
arrived at approximately 1 p.m. and left a few minutes later. At about
1:16 p.m., a Dallas police officer, J. D. Tippit, was shot less than
1 mile from Oswald’s roominghouse. In deciding whether Oswald killed
Patrolman Tippit the Commission considered the following: (1) positive
identification of the killer by two eyewitnesses who saw the shooting
and seven eyewitnesses who heard the shots and saw the gunman flee
the scene with the revolver in his hand, (2) testimony of firearms
identification experts establishing the identity of the murder weapon,
(3) evidence establishing the ownership of the murder weapon, (4)
evidence establishing the ownership of a zipper jacket found along the
path of flight taken by the gunman from the scene of the shooting to
the place of arrest.


Oswald’s Movements After Leaving Depository Building

_The bus ride._--According to the reconstruction of time and events
which the Commission found most credible, Lee Harvey Oswald left the
building approximately 3 minutes after the assassination. He probably
walked east on Elm Street for seven blocks to the corner of Elm and
Murphy where he boarded a bus which was heading back in the direction
of the Depository Building, on its way to the Oak Cliff section of
Dallas. (See Commission Exhibit 1119-A, p. 158.)

When Oswald was apprehended, a bus transfer marked for the
Lakewood-Marsalis route was found in his shirt pocket.[C4-418] The
transfer was dated “Fri. Nov. 22, ’63” and was punched in two places by
the busdriver. On the basis of this punchmark, which was distinctive
to each Dallas driver, the transfer was conclusively identified as
having been issued by Cecil J. McWatters, a busdriver for the Dallas
Transit Co.[C4-419] On the basis of the date and time on the transfer,
McWatters was able to testify that the transfer had been issued by him
on a trip which passed a check point at St. Paul and Elm Streets at
12:36 p.m., November 22, 1963.[C4-420]

McWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time and he
estimated that it took him 3 to 4 minutes to drive three blocks west
from the checkpoint to Field Street, which he reached at about 12:40
p.m.[C4-421] McWatters’ recollection is that he issued this transfer to
a man who entered his bus just beyond Field Street, where a man beat on
the front door of the bus, boarded it and paid his fare.[C4-422] About
two blocks later, a woman asked to get off to make a 1 o’clock train at
Union Station and requested a transfer which she might use if she got
through the traffic.

    * * * So I gave her a transfer and opened the door and she was
    going out the gentleman I had picked up about two blocks [back]
    asked for a transfer and got off at the same place in the
    middle of the block where the lady did.

    * * * It was the intersection near Lamar Street, it was near
    Poydras and Lamar Street.[C4-423]

  WHEREABOUTS OF
  LEE HARVEY OSWALD
  between
  12:33 P.M. and 1:50 P.M.
  November 22, 1963

  (ALL TIMES ARE APPROXIMATE)
] The man was on the bus approximately 4 minutes.[C4-424]

At about 6:30 p.m. on the day of the assassination, McWatters viewed
four men in a police lineup. He picked Oswald from the lineup as the
man who had boarded the bus at the “lower end of town on Elm around
Houston,” and who, during the ride south on Marsalis, had an argument
with a woman passenger.[C4-425] In his Commission testimony, McWatters
said he had been in error and that a teenager named Milton Jones was
the passenger he had in mind.[C4-426] In a later interview, Jones
confirmed that he had exchanged words with a woman passenger on the bus
during the ride south on Marsalis.[C4-427] McWatters also remembered
that a man received a transfer at Lamar and Elm Streets and that a
man in the lineup was about the size of this man.[C4-428] However,
McWatters’ recollection alone was too vague to be a basis for placing
Oswald on the bus.

Riding on the bus was an elderly woman, Mary Bledsoe, who confirmed
the mute evidence of the transfer. Oswald had rented a room from Mrs.
Bledsoe about 6 weeks before, on October 7,[C4-429] but she had asked
him to leave at the end of a week. Mrs. Bledsoe told him “I am not
going to rent to you any more.”[C4-430] She testified, “I didn’t like
his attitude. * * * There was just something about him I didn’t like or
want him. * * * Just didn’t want him around me.” [C4-431] On November
22, Mrs. Bledsoe came downtown to watch the Presidential motorcade.
She boarded the Marsalis bus at St. Paul and Elm Streets to return
home.[C4-432] She testified further:

    And, after we got past Akard, at Murphy--I figured it out.
    Let’s see. I don’t know for sure. Oswald got on. He looks like
    a maniac. His sleeve was out here. * * * His shirt was undone.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Was a hole in it, hole, and he was dirty, and I didn’t look at
    him. I didn’t want to know I even seen him * * *

       *       *       *       *       *

    * * * he looked so bad in his face, and his face was so
    distorted.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Hole in his sleeve right here.[C4-433]

As Mrs. Bledsoe said these words, she pointed to her right
elbow.[C4-434] When Oswald was arrested in the Texas Theatre, he was
wearing a brown sport shirt with a hole in the right sleeve at the
elbow.[C4-435] Mrs. Bledsoe identified the shirt as the one Oswald was
wearing and she stated she was certain that it was Oswald who boarded
the bus.[C4-436] Mrs. Bledsoe recalled that Oswald sat halfway to the
rear of the bus which moved slowly and intermittently as traffic
became heavy.[C4-437] She heard a passing motorist tell the driver that
the President had been shot.[C4-438] People on the bus began talking
about it. As the bus neared Lamar Street, Oswald left the bus and
disappeared into the crowd.[C4-439]

The Marsalis bus which Oswald boarded traveled a route west on Elm,
south on Houston, and southwest across the Houston viaduct to service
the Oak Cliff area along Marsalis.[C4-440] A Beckley bus which also
served the Oak Cliff area, followed the same route as the Marsalis
bus through downtown Dallas, except that it continued west on Elm,
across Houston in front of the Depository Building, past the Triple
Underpass into west Dallas, and south on Beckley.[C4-441] Marsalis
Street is seven blocks from Beckley.[C4-442] Oswald lived at 1026 North
Beckley.[C4-443] He could not reach his roominghouse on the Marsalis
bus, but the Beckley bus stopped across the street.[C4-444] According
to McWatters, the Beckley bus was behind the Marsalis bus, but he did
not actually see it.[C4-445] Both buses stopped within one block of the
Depository Building. Instead of waiting there, Oswald apparently went
as far away as he could and boarded the first Oak Cliff bus which came
along rather than wait for one which stopped across the street from his
roominghouse.

In a reconstruction of this bus trip, agents of the Secret Service
and the FBI walked the seven blocks from the front entrance of the
Depository Building to Murphy and Elm three times, averaging 6½ minutes
for the three trips.[C4-446] A bus moving through heavy traffic on
Elm from Murphy to Lamar was timed at 4 minutes.[C4-447] If Oswald
left the Depository Building at 12:33 p.m., walked seven blocks
directly to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately, he
would have boarded the bus at approximately 12:40 p.m. and left it at
approximately 12:44 p.m. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.)

Roger D. Craig, a deputy sheriff of Dallas County, claimed that
about 15 minutes after the assassination he saw a man, whom he later
identified as Oswald,[C4-448] coming from the direction of the
Depository Building and running down the hill north of Elm Street
toward a light-colored Rambler station wagon, which was moving slowly
along Elm toward the underpass.[C4-449] The station wagon stopped to
pick up the man and then drove off.[C4-450] Craig testified that later
in the afternoon he saw Oswald in the police interrogation room and
told Captain Fritz that Oswald was the man he saw.[C4-451] Craig also
claimed that when Fritz pointed out to Oswald that Craig had identified
him, Oswald rose from his chair, looked directly at Fritz, and said,
“Everybody will know who I am now.”[C4-452]

The Commission could not accept important elements of Craig’s
testimony. Captain Fritz stated that a deputy sheriff whom he could
not identify did ask to see him that afternoon and told him a similar
story to Craig’s.[C4-453] Fritz did not bring him into his office
to identify Oswald but turned him over to Lieutenant Baker for
questioning. If Craig saw Oswald that afternoon, he saw him through the
glass windows of the office. And neither Captain Fritz nor any other
officer can remember that Oswald dramatically arose from his chair
and said, “Everybody will know who I am now.”[C4-454] If Oswald had
made such a statement, Captain Fritz and others present would probably
have remembered it. Craig may have seen a person enter a white Rambler
station wagon 15 or 20 minutes after the shooting and travel west on
Elm Street, but the Commission concluded that this man was not Lee
Harvey Oswald, because of the overwhelming evidence that Oswald was far
away from the building by that time.

_The taxicab ride._--William Whaley, a taxicab driver, told his
employer on Saturday morning, November 23, that he recognized Oswald
from a newspaper photograph as a man whom he had driven to the Oak
Cliff area the day before.[C4-455] Notified of Whaley’s statement, the
police brought him to the police station that afternoon. He was taken
to the lineup room where, according to Whaley, five young teenagers,
all handcuffed together, were displayed with Oswald.[C4-456] He
testified that Oswald looked older than the other boys.[C4-457] The
police asked him whether he could pick out his passenger from the
lineup. Whaley picked Oswald. He said,

    * * * you could have picked him out without identifying him by
    just listening to him because he was bawling out the policeman,
    telling them it wasn’t right to put him in line with these
    teenagers and all of that and they asked me which one and I
    told them. It was him all right, the same man.

       *       *       *       *       *

    He showed no respect for the policemen, he told them what he
    thought about them. They knew what they were doing and they
    were trying to railroad him and he wanted his lawyer.[C4-458]

Whaley believes that Oswald’s conduct did not aid him in his
identification “because I knew he was the right one as soon as I saw
him.”[C4-459]

Whaley’s memory of the lineup is inaccurate. There were four men
altogether, not six men, in the lineup with Oswald.[C4-460] Whaley said
that Oswald was the man under No. 2.[C4-461] Actually Oswald was under
No. 3. Only two of the men in the lineup with Oswald were teenagers:
John T. Horn, aged 18, was No. 1; David Knapp, aged 18, was No. 2; Lee
Oswald was No. 3; and Daniel Lujan, aged 26, was No. 4.[C4-462]

When he first testified before the Commission, Whaley displayed a trip
manifest[C4-463] which showed a 12 o’clock trip from Travis Hotel to
the Continental bus station, unloaded at 12:15 p.m., a 12:15 p.m.
pickup at Continental to Greyhound, unloaded at 12:30 p.m., and a
pickup from Greyhound (bus station) at 12:30 p.m., unloaded at 500
North Beckley at 12:45 p.m. Whaley testified that he did not keep an
accurate time record of his trips but recorded them by the quarter
hour, and that sometimes he made his entry right after a trip while
at other times he waited to record three or four trips.[C4-464] As he
unloaded his Continental bus station passenger in front of Greyhound,
he started to get out to buy a package of cigarettes.[C4-465] He saw a
man walking south on Lamar from Commerce. The man was dressed in faded
blue color khaki work clothes, a brown shirt, and some kind of work
jacket that almost matched his pants.[C4-466] The man asked, “May I
have the cab?”, and got into the front seat.[C4-467] Whaley described
the ensuing events as follows:

    And about that time an old lady, I think she was an old lady,
    I don’t remember nothing but her sticking her head down past
    him in the door and said, “Driver, will you call me a cab down
    here?”

    She had seen him get this cab and she wanted one, too, and he
    opened the door a little bit like he was going to get out and
    he said, “I will let you have this one,” and she says, “No, the
    driver can call me one.”

       *       *       *       *       *

    * * * I asked him where he wanted to go. And he said, “500
    North Beckley.”

    Well, I started up, I started to that address, and the police
    cars, the sirens was going, running crisscrossing everywhere,
    just a big uproar in that end of town and I said, “What the
    hell. I wonder what the hell is the uproar?”

    And he never said anything. So I figured he was one of these
    people that don’t like to talk so I never said any more to him.

    But when I got pretty close to 500 block at Neches and North
    Beckley which is the 500 block, he said, “This will do fine,”
    and I pulled over to the curb right there. He gave me a dollar
    bill, the trip was 95 cents. He gave me a dollar bill and
    didn’t say anything, just got out and closed the door and
    walked around the front of the cab over to the other side of
    the street [east side of the street]. Of course, the traffic
    was moving through there and I put it in gear and moved on,
    that is the last I saw of him.[C4-468]

Whaley was somewhat imprecise as to where he unloaded his passenger.
He marked what he thought was the intersection of Neches and Beckley
on a map of Dallas with a large “X.”[C4-469] He said, “Yes, sir; that
is right, because that is the 500 block of North Beckley.”[C4-470]
However, Neches and Beckley do not intersect. Neches is within one-half
block of the roominghouse at 1026 North Beckley where Oswald was
living. The 500 block of North Beckley is five blocks south of the
roominghouse.[C4-471]

After a review of these inconsistencies in his testimony before the
Commission, Whaley was interviewed again in Dallas. The route of the
taxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.[C4-472] He directed
the driver of the car to a point 20 feet north of the northwest
corner of the intersection of Beckley and Neely, the point at which
he said his passenger alighted.[C4-473] This was the 700 block of
North Beckley.[C4-474] The elapsed time of the reconstructed run from
the Greyhound Bus Station to Neely and Beckley was 5 minutes and 30
seconds by stopwatch.[C4-475] The walk from Beckley and Neely to 1026
North Beckley was timed by Commission counsel at 5 minutes and 45
seconds.[C4-476]

Whaley testified that Oswald was wearing either the gray zippered
jacket or the heavy blue jacket.[C4-477] He was in error, however.
Oswald could not possibly have been wearing the blue jacket during
the trip with Whaley, since it was found in the “domino” room of
the Depository late in November.[C4-478] Moreover, Mrs. Bledsoe saw
Oswald in the bus without a jacket and wearing a shirt with a hole at
the elbow.[C4-479] On the other hand, Whaley identified Commission
Exhibit No. 150 (the shirt taken from Oswald upon arrest) as the shirt
his passenger was wearing.[C4-480] He also stated he saw a silver
identification bracelet on his passenger’s left wrist.[C4-481] Oswald
was wearing such a bracelet when he was arrested.[C4-482]

On November 22, Oswald told Captain Fritz that he rode a bus to a stop
near his home and then walked to his roominghouse.[C4-483] When queried
the following morning concerning a bus transfer found in his possession
at the time of his arrest, he admitted receiving it.[C4-484] And when
interrogated about a cab ride, Oswald also admitted that he left the
slow-moving bus and took a cab to his roominghouse.[C4-485]

The Greyhound Bus Station at Lamar and Jackson Streets, where Oswald
entered Whaley’s cab, is three to four short blocks south of Lamar and
Elm.[C4-486] If Oswald left the bus at 12:44 p.m. and walked directly
to the terminal, he would have entered the cab at 12:47 or 12:48 p.m.
If the cab ride was approximately 6 minutes, as was the reconstructed
ride, he would have reached his destination at approximately 12:54
p.m. If he was discharged at Neely and Beckley and walked directly to
his roominghouse, he would have arrived there about 12:59 to 1 p.m.
From the 500 block of North Beckley, the walk would be a few minutes
longer, but in either event he would have been in the roominghouse at
about 1 p.m. This is the approximate time he entered the roominghouse,
according to Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper there.[C4-487] (See
Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.)

_Arrival and departure from roominghouse._--Earlene Roberts,
housekeeper for Mrs. A.C. Johnson at 1026 North Beckley, knew Lee
Harvey Oswald under the alias of O. H. Lee. She first saw him the day
he rented a room at that address on October 14, 1963.[C4-488] He signed
his name as O. H. Lee on the roominghouse register.[C4-489]

Mrs. Roberts testified that on Thursday, November 21, Oswald did not
come home. On Friday, November 22, about 1 p.m., he entered the house
in unusual haste. She recalled that it was subsequent to the time
the President had been shot. After a friend had called and told her,
“President Kennedy has been shot,” she turned on the television. When
Oswald came in she said, “Oh, you are in a hurry,” but Oswald did
not respond. He hurried to his room and stayed no longer than 3 or 4
minutes. Oswald had entered the house in his shirt sleeves, but when he
left, he was zipping up a jacket. Mrs. Roberts saw him a few seconds
later standing near the bus stop in front of the house on the east side
of Beckley.[C4-490]

[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1968

LOCATION OF EYEWITNESSES TO THE MOVEMENTS OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD IN THE
VICINITY OF THE TIPPIT KILLING]

Oswald was next seen about nine-tenths of a mile away at the southeast
corner of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, moments before the Tippit
shooting. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.) If Oswald left
his roominghouse shortly after 1 p.m. and walked at a brisk pace, he
would have reached 10th and Patton shortly after 1:15 p.m.[C4-491]
Tippit’s murder was recorded on the police radio tape at about 1:16
p.m.[C4-492]


Description of Shooting

Patrolman J. D. Tippit joined the Dallas Police Department in July
1952.[C4-493] He was described by Chief Curry as having the reputation
of being “a very fine, dedicated officer.”[C4-494] Tippit patroled
district No. 78 in the Oak Cliff area of Dallas during daylight
hours. He drove a police car painted distinctive colors with No. 10
prominently displayed on each side. Tippit rode alone, as only one
man was normally assigned to a patrol car in residential areas during
daylight shifts.[C4-495]

At about 12:44 p.m. on November 22, the radio dispatcher on channel 1
ordered all downtown patrol squads to report to Elm and Houston, code
3 (emergency).[C4-496] At 12:45 p.m. the dispatcher ordered No. 78
(Tippit) to “move into central Oak Cliff area.”[C4-497] At 12:54 p.m.,
Tippit reported that he was in the central Oak Cliff area at Lancaster
and Eighth. The dispatcher ordered Tippit to be: “* * * at large for
any emergency that comes in.”[C4-498] According to Chief Curry, Tippit
was free to patrol the central Oak Cliff area.[C4-499] Tippit must
have heard the description of the suspect wanted for the President’s
shooting; it was broadcast over channel 1 at 12:45 p.m., again at 12:48
p.m., and again at 12:55 p.m.[C4-500] The suspect was described as a
“white male, approximately 30, slender build, height 5 foot 10 inches,
weight 165 pounds.”[C4-501] A similar description was given on channel
2 at 12:45 p.m.[C4-502]

At approximately 1:15 p.m., Tippit, who was cruising east on 10th
Street, passed the intersection of 10th and Patton, about eight blocks
from where he had reported at 12:54 p.m. About 100 feet past the
intersection Tippit stopped a man walking east along the south side of
Patton. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p. 164.) The man’s general
description was similar to the one broadcast over the police radio.
Tippit stopped the man and called him to his car. He approached the
car and apparently exchanged words with Tippit through the right front
or vent window. Tippit got out and started to walk around the front of
the car. As Tippit reached the left front wheel the man pulled out a
revolver and fired several shots. Four bullets hit Tippit and killed
him instantly. The gunman started back toward Patton Avenue, ejecting
the empty cartridge cases before reloading with fresh bullets.


Eyewitnesses

At least 12 persons saw the man with the revolver in the vicinity of
the Tippit crime scene at or immediately after the shooting. By the
evening of November 22, five of them had identified Lee Harvey Oswald
in police lineups as the man they saw. A sixth did so the next day.
Three others subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph. Two
witnesses testified that Oswald resembled the man they had seen. One
witness felt he was too distant from the gunman to make a positive
identification. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p. 164.)

A taxi driver, William Scoggins, was eating lunch in his cab which
was parked on Patton facing the southeast corner of 10th Street and
Patton Avenue a few feet to the north.[C4-503] A police car moving
east on 10th at about 10 or 12 miles an hour passed in front of his
cab. About 100 feet from the corner the police car pulled up alongside
a man on the sidewalk. This man, dressed in a light-colored jacket,
approached the car. Scoggins lost sight of him behind some shrubbery
on the southeast corner lot, but he saw the policeman leave the car,
heard three or four shots, and then saw the policeman fall. Scoggins
hurriedly left his seat and hid behind the cab as the man came back
toward the corner with gun in hand. The man cut across the yard through
some bushes, passed within 12 feet of Scoggins, and ran south on
Patton. Scoggins saw him and heard him mutter either “Poor damn cop”
or “Poor dumb cop.”[C4-504] The next day Scoggins viewed a lineup of
four persons and identified Oswald as the man whom he had seen the
day before at 10th and Patton.[C4-505] In his testimony before the
Commission, Scoggins stated that he thought he had seen a picture
of Oswald in the newspapers prior to the lineup identification on
Saturday. He had not seen Oswald on television and had not been shown
any photographs of Oswald by the police.[C4-506]

Another witness, Domingo Benavides, was driving a pickup truck west on
10th Street. As he crossed the intersection a block east of 10th and
Patton, he saw a policeman standing by the left door of the police car
parked along the south side of 10th. Benavides saw a man standing at
the right side of the parked police car. He then heard three shots and
saw the policeman fall to the ground. By this time the pickup truck
was across the street and about 25 feet from the police car. Benavides
stopped and waited in the truck until the gunman ran to the corner.
He saw him empty the gun and throw the shells into some bushes on the
southeast corner lot.[C4-507] It was Benavides, using Tippit’s car
radio, who first reported the killing of Patrolman Tippit at about
1:16 p.m.: “We’ve had a shooting out here.”[C4-508] He found two empty
shells in the bushes and gave them to Patrolman J. M. Poe who arrived
on the scene shortly after the shooting.[C4-509] Benavides never saw
Oswald after the arrest. When questioned by police officers on the
evening of November 22, Benavides told them that he did not think that
he could identify the man who fired the shots. As a result, they did
not take him to the police station. He testified that the picture of
Oswald which he saw later on television bore a resemblance to the man
who shot Officer Tippit.[C4-510]

Just prior to the shooting, Mrs. Helen Markham, a waitress in
downtown Dallas, was about to cross 10th Street at Patton. As she
waited on the northwest corner of the intersection for traffic to
pass,[C4-511] she noticed a young man as he was “almost ready to get
up on the curb”[C4-512] at the southeast corner of the intersection,
approximately 50 feet away. The man continued along 10th Street. Mrs.
Markham saw a police car slowly approach the man from the rear and
stop alongside of him. She saw the man come to the right window of the
police car. As he talked, he leaned on the ledge of the right window
with his arms. The man appeared to step back as the policeman “calmly
opened the car door” and very slowly got out and walked toward the
front of the car. The man pulled a gun. Mrs. Markham heard three shots
and saw the policeman fall to the ground near the left front wheel. She
raised her hands to her eyes as the man started to walk back toward
Patton.[C4-513] She peered through her fingers, lowered her hands, and
saw the man doing something with his gun. “He was just fooling with it.
I didn’t know what he was doing. I was afraid he was fixing to kill
me.”[C4-514] The man “in kind of a little trot” headed down Patton
toward Jefferson Boulevard, a block away. Mrs. Markham then ran to
Officer Tippit’s side and saw him lying in a pool of blood.[C4-515]

Helen Markham was screaming as she leaned over the body.[C4-516] A
few minutes later she described the gunman to a policeman.[C4-517]
Her description and that of other eyewitnesses led to the police
broadcast at 1:22 p.m. describing the slayer as “about 30, 5’8”,
black hair, slender.”[C4-518] At about 4:30 p.m., Mrs. Markham, who
had been greatly upset by her experience, was able to view a lineup
of four men handcuffed together at the police station.[C4-519] She
identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man who shot the policeman.[C4-520]
Detective L. C. Graves, who had been with Mrs. Markham before the
lineup testified that she was “quite hysterical” and was “crying
and upset.”[C4-521] He said that Mrs. Markham started crying when
Oswald walked into the lineup room.[C4-522] In testimony before the
Commission, Mrs. Markham confirmed her positive identification of Lee
Harvey Oswald as the man she saw kill Officer Tippit.[C4-523]

In evaluating Mrs. Markham’s identification of Oswald, the Commission
considered certain allegations that Mrs. Markham described the man
who killed Patrolman Tippit as “short, a little on the heavy side,”
and having “somewhat bushy” hair.[C4-524] The Commission reviewed the
transcript of a phone conversation in which Mrs. Markham is alleged
to have provided such a description.[C4-525] A review of the complete
transcript has satisfied the Commission that Mrs. Markham strongly
reaffirmed her positive identification of Oswald and denied having
described the killer as short, stocky and having bushy hair. She
stated that the man weighed about 150 pounds.[C4-526] Although she
used the words “a little bit bushy” to describe the gunman’s hair,
the transcript establishes that she was referring to the uncombed
state of his hair, a description fully supported by a photograph of
Oswald taken at the time of his arrest. (See Pizzo Exhibit No. 453-C,
p. 177.) Although in the phone conversation she described the man as
“short,”[C4-527] on November 22, within minutes of the shooting and
before the lineup, Mrs. Markham described the man to the police as 5’8”
tall.[C4-528]

During her testimony Mrs. Markham initially denied that she ever had
the above phone conversation.[C4-529] She has subsequently admitted
the existence of the conversation and offered an explanation for her
denial.[C4-530] Addressing itself solely to the probative value of Mrs.
Markham’s contemporaneous description of the gunman and her positive
identification of Oswald at a police lineup, the Commission considers
her testimony reliable. However, even in the absence of Mrs. Markham’s
testimony, there is ample evidence to identify Oswald as the killer of
Tippit.

Two young women, Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis, were in an
apartment of a multiple-unit house on the southeast corner of 10th and
Patton when they heard the sound of gunfire and the screams of Helen
Markham. They ran to the door in time to see a man with a revolver
cut across their lawn and disappear around a corner of the house onto
Patton.[C4-531] Barbara Jeanette Davis assumed that he was emptying his
gun as “he had it open and was shaking it.”[C4-532] She immediately
called the police. Later in the day each woman found an empty shell
on the ground near the house. These two shells were delivered to the
police.[C4-533]

On the evening of November 22, Barbara Jeanette and Virginia Davis
viewed a group of four men in a lineup and each one picked Oswald as
the man who crossed their lawn while emptying his pistol.[C4-534]
Barbara Jeanette Davis testified that no one had shown her a picture
of Oswald before the identification and that she had not seen him
on television. She was not sure whether she had seen his picture in
a newspaper on the afternoon or evening of November 22 prior to the
lineup.[C4-535] Her reaction when she saw Oswald in the lineup was that
“I was pretty sure it was the same man I saw. When they made him turn
sideways, I was positive that was the one I seen.”[C4-536] Similarly,
Virginia Davis had not been shown pictures of anyone prior to the
lineup and had not seen either television or the newspapers during the
afternoon.[C4-537] She identified Oswald, who was the No. 2 man in the
lineup,[C4-538] as the man she saw running with the gun: she testified,
“I would say that was him for sure.”[C4-539] Barbara Jeanette Davis
and Virginia Davis were sitting alongside each other when they made
their positive identifications of Oswald.[C4-540] Each woman whispered
Oswald’s number to the detective. Each testified that she was the first
to make the identification.[C4-541]

William Arthur Smith was about a block east of 10th and Patton when
he heard shots. He looked west on 10th and saw a man running to the
west and a policeman falling to the ground. Smith failed to make
himself known to the police on November 22. Several days later he
reported what he had seen and was questioned by FBI agents.[C4-542]
Smith subsequently told a Commission staff member that he saw Oswald
on television the night of the murder and thought that Oswald was the
man he had seen running away from the shooting.[C4-543] On television
Oswald’s hair looked blond, whereas Smith remembered that the man
who ran away had hair that was brown or brownish black. Later, the
FBI showed Smith a picture of Oswald. In the picture the hair was
brown.[C4-544] According to his testimony, Smith told the FBI, “It
looked more like him than it did on television.” He stated further
that from “What I saw of him” the man looked like the man in the
picture.[C4-545]

Two other important eyewitnesses to Oswald’s flight were Ted Callaway,
manager of a used-car lot on the northeast corner of Patton Avenue
and Jefferson Boulevard, and Sam Guinyard, a porter at the lot. They
heard the sound of shots to the north of their lot.[C4-546] Callaway
heard five shots, and Guinyard three. Both ran to the sidewalk on the
east side of Patton at a point about a half a block south of 10th.
They saw a man coming south on Patton with a revolver held high in his
right hand. According to Callaway, the man crossed to the west side
of Patton.[C4-547] From across the street Callaway yelled, “Hey, man,
what the hell is going on?” He slowed down, halted, said something,
and then kept on going to the corner, turned right, and continued west
on Jefferson.[C4-548] Guinyard claimed that the man ran down the east
side of Patton and passed within 10 feet of him before crossing to the
other side.[C4-549] Guinyard and Callaway ran to 10th and Patton and
found Tippit lying in the street beside his car.[C4-550] Apparently he
had reached for his gun; it lay beneath him outside of the holster.
Callaway picked up the gun.[C4-551] He and Scoggins attempted to chase
down the gunman in Scoggin’s taxicab,[C4-552] but he had disappeared.
Early in the evening of November 22, Guinyard and Callaway viewed the
same lineup of four men from which Mrs. Markham had earlier made her
identification of Lee Harvey Oswald. Both men picked Oswald as the man
who had run south on Patton with a gun in his hand.[C4-553] Callaway
told the Commission: “So they brought four men in. I stepped to the
back of the room, so I could kind of see him from the same distance
which I had seen him before. And when he came out I knew him.”[C4-554]
Guinyard said, “I told them that was him right there. I pointed him out
right there.”[C4-555] Both Callaway and Guinyard testified that they
had not been shown any pictures by the police before the lineup.[C4-556]

The Dallas Police Department furnished the Commission with pictures
of the men who appeared in the lineups with Oswald,[C4-557] and the
Commission has inquired into general lineup procedures used by the
Dallas police as well as the specific procedures in the lineups
involving Oswald.[C4-558] The Commission is satisfied that the lineups
were conducted fairly.

[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 143

REVOLVER USED IN TIPPIT KILLING]

As Oswald ran south on Patton Avenue toward Jefferson Boulevard
he was moving in the direction of a used-car lot located on the
southeast corner of this intersection.[C4-559] Four men--Warren
Reynolds,[C4-560] Harold Russell,[C4-561] Pat Patterson,[C4-562] and
L. J. Lewis[C4-563]--were on the lot at the time, and they saw a white
male with a revolver in his hands running south on Patton. When the
man reached Jefferson, he turned right and headed west. Reynolds and
Patterson decided to follow him. When he reached a gasoline service
station one block away he turned north and walked toward a parking
area in the rear of the station. Neither Reynolds nor Patterson saw
the man after he turned off Jefferson at the service station.[C4-564]
These four witnesses were interviewed by FBI agents 2 months after
the shooting. Russell and Patterson were shown a picture of Oswald
and they stated that Oswald was the man they saw on November 22,
1963. Russell confirmed this statement in a sworn affidavit for
the Commission.[C4-565] Patterson, when asked later to confirm his
identification by affidavit said he did not recall having been shown
the photograph. He was then shown two photographs of Oswald and he
advised that Oswald was “unquestionably” the man he saw.[C4-566]
Reynolds did not make a positive identification when interviewed by the
FBI, but he subsequently testified before a Commission staff member
and, when shown two photographs of Oswald, stated that they were
photographs of the man he saw.[C4-567] L. J. Lewis said in an interview
that because of the distance from which he observed the gunman he would
hesitate to state whether the man was identical with Oswald.[C4-568]


Murder Weapon

When Oswald was arrested, he had in his possession a Smith & Wesson
.38 Special caliber revolver, serial number V510210. (See Commission
Exhibit No. 143, p. 170). Two of the arresting officers placed their
initials on the weapon and a third inscribed his name. All three
identified Exhibit No. 143 as the revolver taken from Oswald when he
was arrested.[C4-569] Four cartridge cases were found in the shrubbery
on the corner of 10th and Patton by three of the eyewitnesses--Domingo
Benavides, Barbara Jeanette Davis, and Virginia Davis.[C4-570] It was
the unanimous and unequivocal testimony of expert witnesses before the
Commission that these used cartridge cases were fired from the revolver
in Oswald’s possession to the exclusion of all other weapons. (See app.
X, p. 559.)

Cortlandt Cunningham, of the Firearms Identification Unit of the
FBI Laboratory, testified that he compared the four empty cartridge
cases found near the scene of the shooting with a test cartridge
fired from the weapon in Oswald’s possession when he was arrested.
Cunningham declared that this weapon fired the four cartridges to the
exclusion of all other weapons. Identification was effected through
breech face marks and firing pin marks.[C4-571] Robert A. Frazier and
Charles Killion, other FBI firearms experts, independently examined
the four cartridge cases and arrived at the same conclusion as
Cunningham.[C4-572] At the request of the Commission, Joseph D. Nicol,
superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal Identification
Investigation, also examined the four cartridge cases found near the
site of the homicide and compared them with the test cartridge cases
fired from the Smith & Wesson revolver taken from Oswald. He concluded
that all of these cartridges were fired from the same weapon.[C4-573]

Cunningham compared four lead bullets recovered from the body
of Patrolman Tippit with test bullets fired from Oswald’s
revolver.[C4-574] He explained that the bullets were slightly smaller
than the barrel of the pistol which had fired them. This caused the
bullets to have an erratic passage through the barrel and impressed
upon the lead of the bullets inconsistent individual characteristics
which made identification impossible. Consecutive bullets fired from
the revolver by the FBI experts could not be identified as having been
fired from that revolver.[C4-575] (See app. X, p. 559.) Cunningham
testified that all of the bullets were mutilated, one being useless
for comparison purposes. All four bullets were fired from a weapon
with five lands and grooves and a right twist[C4-576] which were
the rifling characteristics of the revolver taken from Oswald. He
concluded, however, that he could not say whether the four bullets
were fired from the revolver in Oswald’s possession.[C4-577] “The only
thing I can testify is they could have on the basis of the rifling
characteristics--they could have been.”[C4-578]

Nicol differed with the FBI experts on one bullet taken from Tippit’s
body. He declared that this bullet[C4-579] was fired from the same
weapon that fired the test bullets to the exclusion of all other
weapons. But he agreed that because the other three bullets were
mutilated, he could not determine if they had been fired from the same
weapon as the test bullets.[C4-580]

The examination and testimony of the experts enabled the Commission to
conclude that five shots may have been fired, even though only four
bullets were recovered. Three of the bullets recovered from Tippit’s
body were manufactured by Winchester-Western, and the fourth bullet
by Remington-Peters, but only two of the four discarded cartridge
cases found on the lawn at 10th Street and Patton Avenue were of
Winchester-Western manufacture.[C4-581] Therefore, one cartridge
case of this type was not recovered. And though only one bullet of
Remington-Peters manufacture was recovered, two empty cartridge
cases of that make were retrieved. Therefore, either one bullet of
Remington-Peters manufacture is missing or one used Remington-Peters
cartridge case, which may have been in the revolver before the
shooting, was discarded along with the others as Oswald left the scene.
If a bullet is missing, five were fired. This corresponds with the
observation and memory of Ted Callaway,[C4-582] and possibly Warren
Reynolds, but not with the other eyewitnesses who claim to have heard
from two to four shots.


Ownership of Revolver

By checking certain importers and dealers after the assassination
of President Kennedy and slaying of Officer Tippit, agents of the
FBI determined that George Rose & Co. of Los Angeles was a major
distributor of this type of revolver.[C4-583] Records of Seaport
Traders, Inc., a mail-order division of George Rose & Co., disclosed
that on January 3, 1963, the company received from Empire Wholesale
Sporting Goods, Ltd., Montreal, a shipment of 99 guns in one case.
Among these guns was a .38 Special caliber Smith & Wesson revolver,
serial No. V510210, the only revolver made by Smith & Wesson with
this serial number.[C4-584] When first manufactured, it had a 5-inch
barrel. George Rose & Co. had the barrel shortened by a gunsmith to 2¼
inches.[C4-585]

[Illustration: REVOLVER PURCHASE AND SHIPPING DOCUMENTS

COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 790

MICHAELIS EXHIBIT NO. 2

MICHAELIS EXHIBIT NO. 5]

Sometime after January 27, 1963, Seaport Traders, Inc., received
through the mail a mail-order coupon for one “.38 St. W. 2” Bbl.,” cost
$29.95. Ten dollars in cash was enclosed. The order was signed in ink
by “A. J. Hidell, aged 28.”[C4-586] (See Commission Exhibit No. 790,
p. 173.) The date of the order was January 27 (no year shown), and the
return address was Post Office Box 2915, Dallas, Tex. Also on the order
form was an order, written in ink, for one box of ammunition and one
holster, but a line was drawn through these items. The mail-order form
had a line for the name of a witness to attest that the person ordering
the gun was a U.S. citizen and had not been convicted of a felony. The
name written in this space was D. F. Drittal.[C4-587]

Heinz W. Michaelis, office manager of both George Rose & Co., Inc., and
Seaport Traders, Inc., identified records of Seaport Traders, Inc.,
which showed that a “.38 S and W Special two-inch Commando, serial
number V510210” was shipped on March 20, 1963, to A. J. Hidell, Post
Office Box 2915, Dallas, Tex. The invoice was prepared on March 13,
1963; the revolver was actually shipped on March 20 by Railway Express.
The balance due on the purchase was $19.95. Michaelis furnished the
shipping copy of the invoice, and the Railway Express Agency shipping
documents, showing that $19.95, plus $1.27 shipping charge, had been
collected from the consignee, Hidell.[C4-588] (See Michaelis Exhibits
Nos. 2, 4, 5, p. 173.)

Handwriting experts, Alwyn Cole of the Treasury Department and James
C. Cadigan of the FBI, testified before the Commission that the
writing on the coupon was Oswald’s. The signature of the witness,
D. F. Drittal, who attested that the fictitious Hidell was an American
citizen and had not been convicted of a felony, was also in Oswald’s
handwriting.[C4-589] Marina Oswald gave as her opinion that the
mail-order coupon was in Oswald’s handwriting.[C4-590] When shown
the revolver, she stated that she recognized it as the one owned by
her husband.[C4-591] She also testified that this appeared to be
the revolver seen in Oswald’s belt in the picture she took in late
March or early April 1963 when the family was living on Neely Street
in Dallas.[C4-592] Police found an empty revolver holster when they
searched Oswald’s room on Beckley Avenue after his arrest.[C4-593]
Marina Oswald testified that this was the holster which contained the
revolver in the photographs taken on Neely Street.[C4-594]


Oswald’s Jacket

Approximately 15 minutes before the shooting of Tippit, Oswald was
seen leaving his roominghouse.[C4-595] He was wearing a zipper
jacket which he had not been wearing moments before when he had
arrived home.[C4-596] When Oswald was arrested, he did not have a
jacket.[C4-597] Shortly after Tippit was slain, policemen found a
light-colored zipper jacket along the route taken by the killer as he
attempted to escape.[C4-598] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p. 164.)

At 1:22 p.m. the Dallas police radio described the man wanted for the
murder of Tippit as “a white male about thirty, five foot eight inches,
black hair, slender, wearing a white jacket, white shirt and dark
slacks.”[C4-599] According to Patrolman Poe this description came from
Mrs. Markham and Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis.[C4-600] Mrs. Markham told
Poe that the man was a “white male, about 25, about five feet eight,
brown hair, medium,” and wearing a “white jacket.” Mrs. Davis gave Poe
the same general description: a “white male in his early twenties,
around five foot seven inches or eight inches, about 145 pounds,” and
wearing a white jacket.

As has been discussed previously, two witnesses, Warren Reynolds and
B. M. Patterson, saw the gunman run toward the rear of a gasoline
service station on Jefferson Boulevard. Mrs. Mary Brock, the wife of a
mechanic who worked at the station, was there at the time and she saw
a white male, “5 feet, 10 inches * * * wearing light clothing * * * a
light-colored jacket” walk past her at a fast pace with his hands in
his pocket. She last saw him in the parking lot directly behind the
service station. When interviewed by FBI agents on January 21, 1964,
she identified a picture of Oswald as being the same person she saw on
November 22. She confirmed this interview by a sworn affidavit.[C4-601]

At 1:24 p.m., the police radio reported, “The suspect last seen running
west on Jefferson from 400 East Jefferson.”[C4-602] Police Capt. W. R.
Westbrook and several other officers concentrated their search along
Jefferson Boulevard.[C4-603] Westbrook walked through the parking lot
behind the service station[C4-604] and found a light-colored jacket
lying under the rear of one of the cars.[C4-605] Westbrook identified
Commission Exhibit No. 162 as the light-colored jacket which he
discovered underneath the automobile.[C4-606]

This jacket belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald. Marina Oswald stated
that her husband owned only two jackets, one blue and the other
gray.[C4-607] The blue jacket was found in the Texas School Book
Depository[C4-608] and was identified by Marina Oswald as her
husband’s.[C4-609] Marina Oswald also identified Commission Exhibit No.
162, the jacket found by Captain Westbrook, as her husband’s second
jacket.[C4-610]

The eyewitnesses vary in their identification of the jacket. Mrs.
Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper at Oswald’s roominghouse and the last
person known to have seen him before he reached 10th Street and Patton
Avenue, said that she may have seen the gray zipper jacket but she was
not certain. It seemed to her that the jacket Oswald wore was darker
than Commission Exhibit No. 162.[C4-611] Ted Callaway, who saw the
gunman moments after the shooting, testified that Commission Exhibit
No. 162 looked like the jacket he was wearing but “I thought it had a
little more tan to it.”[C4-612] Two other witnesses, Sam Guinyard and
William Arthur Smith, testified that Commission Exhibit No. 162 was
the jacket worn by the man they saw on November 22. Mrs. Markham and
Barbara Davis thought that the jacket worn by the slayer of Tippit was
darker than the jacket found by Westbrook.[C4-613] Scoggins thought it
was lighter.[C4-614]

There is no doubt, however, that Oswald was seen leaving his
roominghouse at about 1 p.m. wearing a zipper jacket, that the man who
killed Tippit was wearing a light-colored jacket, that he was seen
running along Jefferson Boulevard, that a jacket was found under a car
in a lot adjoining Jefferson Boulevard, that the jacket belonged to
Lee Harvey Oswald, and that when he was arrested at approximately 1:50
p.m., he was in shirt sleeves. These facts warrant the finding that Lee
Harvey Oswald disposed of his jacket as he fled from the scene of the
Tippit killing.


Conclusion

The foregoing evidence establishes that (1) two eyewitnesses who heard
the shots and saw the shooting of Dallas Police Patrolman J. D. Tippit
and seven eyewitnesses who saw the flight of the gunman with revolver
in hand positively identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw
fire the shots or flee from the scene, (2) the cartridge cases found
near the scene of the shooting were fired from the revolver in the
possession of Oswald at the time of his arrest, to the exclusion of all
other weapons, (3) the revolver in Oswald’s possession at the time of
his arrest was purchased by and belonged to Oswald, and (4) Oswald’s
jacket was found along the path of flight taken by the gunman as he
fled from the scene of the killing. On the basis of this evidence
the Commission concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Dallas Police
Patrolman J.D. Tippit.


OSWALD’S ARREST

The Texas Theatre is on the north side of Jefferson Boulevard,
approximately eight blocks from the scene of the Tippit shooting and
six blocks from where several witnesses last saw Oswald running west on
Jefferson Boulevard.[C4-615] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p. 164.)
Shortly after the Tippit murder, police sirens sounded along Jefferson
Boulevard. One of the persons who heard the sirens was Johnny Calvin
Brewer, manager of Hardy’s Shoestore, a few doors east of the Texas
Theatre. Brewer knew from radio broadcasts that the President had been
shot and that a patrolman had also been shot in Oak Cliff.[C4-616]
When he heard police sirens, he “looked up and saw the man enter the
lobby,” a recessed area extending about 15 feet between the sidewalk
and the front door of his store.[C4-617] A police car made a =U=-turn,
and as the sirens grew fainter, the man in the lobby “looked over his
shoulder and turned around and walked up West Jefferson towards the
theatre.”[C4-618] The man wore a T-shirt beneath his outer shirt and he
had no jacket.[C4-619] Brewer said, “He just looked funny to me. * * *
His hair was sort of messed up and looked like he had been running, and
he looked scared, and he looked funny.”[C4-620]

OSWALD AT DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT

COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1797

OSWALD AT DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT]

Mrs. Julia Postal, selling tickets at the box office of the Texas
Theatre, heard police sirens and then saw a man as he “ducked into”
the outer lobby space of the theatre near the ticket office.[C4-621]
Attracted by the sound of the sirens, Mrs. Postal stepped out of the
box office and walked to the curb.[C4-622] Shortly thereafter, Johnny
Brewer, who had come from the nearby shoestore, asked Mrs. Postal
whether the fellow that had ducked in had bought a ticket.[C4-623] She
said, “No; by golly, he didn’t,” and turned around, but the man was
nowhere in sight.[C4-624] Brewer told Mrs. Postal that he had seen the
man ducking into his place of business and that he had followed him
to the theatre.[C4-625] She sent Brewer into the theatre to find the
man and check the exits, told him about the assassination, and said “I
don’t know if this is the man they want * * * but he is running from
them for some reason.”[C4-626] She then called the police.[C4-627]

At 1:45 p.m., the police radio stated, “Have information a suspect
just went in the Texas Theatre on West Jefferson.”[C4-628] Patrol cars
bearing at least 15 officers converged on the Texas Theatre.[C4-629]
Patrolman M. N. McDonald, with Patrolmen R. Hawkins, T. A. Hutson,
and C. T. Walker, entered the theatre from the rear.[C4-630] Other
policemen entered the front door and searched the balcony.[C4-631]
Detective Paul L. Bentley rushed to the balcony and told the
projectionist to turn up the house lights.[C4-632] Brewer met McDonald
and the other policemen at the alley exit door, stepped out onto the
stage with them[C4-633] and pointed out the man who had come into the
theatre without paying.[C4-634] The man was Oswald. He was sitting
alone in the rear of the main floor of the theatre near the right
center aisle.[C4-635] About six or seven people were seated on the
theatre’s main floor and an equal number in the balcony.[C4-636]

McDonald first searched two men in the center of the main floor,
about 10 rows from the front.[C4-637] He walked out of the row up
the right center aisle.[C4-638] When he reached the row where the
suspect was sitting, McDonald stopped abruptly and told the man to
get on his feet.[C4-639] Oswald rose from his seat, bringing up both
hands.[C4-640] As McDonald started to search Oswald’s waist for a
gun, he heard him say, “Well, it’s all over now.”[C4-641] Oswald then
struck McDonald between the eyes with his left fist; with his right
hand he drew a gun from his waist.[C4-642] McDonald struck back with
his right hand and grabbed the gun with his left hand.[C4-643] They
both fell into the seats.[C4-644] Three other officers, moving toward
the scuffle, grabbed Oswald from the front, rear and side.[C4-645] As
McDonald fell into the seat with his left hand on the gun, he felt
something graze across his hand and heard what sounded like the snap of
the hammer.[C4-646] McDonald felt the pistol scratch his cheek as he
wrenched it away from Oswald.[C4-647] Detective Bob K. Carroll, who was
standing beside McDonald, seized the gun from him.[C4-648]

The other officers who helped subdue Oswald corroborated McDonald in
his testimony except that they did not hear Oswald say, “It’s all
over now.” Deputy Sheriff Eddy R. Walthers recalled such a remark
but he did not reach the scene of the struggle until Oswald had been
knocked to the floor by McDonald and the others.[C4-649] Some of the
officers saw Oswald strike McDonald with his fist.[C4-650] Most of them
heard a click which they assumed to be a click of the hammer of the
revolver.[C4-651] Testimony of a firearms expert before the Commission
established that the hammer of the revolver never touched the shell in
the chamber.[C4-652] Although the witnesses did not hear the sound of
a misfire, they might have heard a snapping noise resulting from the
police officer grabbing the cylinder of the revolver and pulling it
away from Oswald while he was attempting to pull the trigger.[C4-653]
(See app. X, p. 560.)

Two patrons of the theatre and John Brewer testified regarding the
arrest of Oswald, as did the various police officers who participated
in the fight. George Jefferson Applin, Jr., confirmed that Oswald
fought with four or five officers before he was handcuffed.[C4-654] He
added that one officer grabbed the muzzle of a shotgun, drew back, and
hit Oswald with the butt end of the gun in the back.[C4-655] No other
theatre patron or officer has testified that Oswald was hit by a gun.
Nor did Oswald ever complain that he was hit with a gun, or injured in
the back. Deputy Sheriff Walthers brought a shotgun into the theatre
but laid it on some seats before helping to subdue Oswald.[C4-656]
Officer Ray Hawkins said that there was no one near Oswald who had a
shotgun and he saw no one strike Oswald in the back with a rifle butt
or the butt of a gun.[C4-657]

John Gibson, another patron in the theatre, saw an officer grab Oswald,
and he claims that he heard the click of a gun misfiring.[C4-658] He
saw no shotgun in the possession of any policeman near Oswald.[C4-659]
Johnny Brewer testified he saw Oswald pull the revolver and the
officers struggle with him to take it away but that once he was
subdued, no officer struck him.[C4-660] He further stated that
while fists were flying he heard one of the officers say “Kill the
President, will you.”[C4-661] It is unlikely that any of the police
officers referred to Oswald as a suspect in the assassination. While
the police radio had noted the similarity in description of the two
suspects, the arresting officers were pursuing Oswald for the murder
of Tippit.[C4-662] As Oswald, handcuffed, was led from the theatre, he
was, according to McDonald, “cursing a little bit and hollering police
brutality.”[C4-663] At 1:51 p.m., police car 2 reported by radio that
it was on the way to headquarters with the suspect.[C4-664]

Captain Fritz returned to police headquarters from the Texas
School Book Depository at 2:15 after a brief stop at the sheriff’s
office.[C4-665] When he entered the homicide and robbery bureau office,
he saw two detectives standing there with Sgt. Gerald L. Hill, who had
driven from the theatre with Oswald.[C4-666] Hill testified that Fritz
told the detective to get a search warrant, go to an address on Fifth
Street in Irving, and pick up a man named Lee Oswald. When Hill asked
why Oswald was wanted, Fritz replied, “Well, he was employed down at
the Book Depository and he had not been present for a roll call of the
employees.”[C4-667] Hill said, “Captain, we will save you a trip * * *
there he sits.”[C4-668]


STATEMENTS OF OSWALD DURING DETENTION

Oswald was questioned intermittently for approximately 12 hours between
2:30 p.m., on November 22, and 11 a.m., on November 24. Throughout
this interrogation he denied that he had anything to do either with
the assassination of President Kennedy or the murder of Patrolman
Tippit. Captain Fritz of the homicide and robbery bureau did most of
the questioning, but he kept no notes and there were no stenographic
or tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies
were also present, including the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service. They
occasionally participated in the questioning. The reports prepared by
those present at these interviews are set forth in appendix XI. A full
discussion of Oswald’s detention and interrogation is presented in
chapter V of this report.

During the evening of November 22, the Dallas Police Department
performed paraffin tests on Oswald’s hands and right cheek in an
apparent effort to determine, by means of a scientific test, whether
Oswald had recently fired a weapon. The results were positive for
the hands and negative for the right cheek.[C4-669] Expert testimony
before the Commission was to the effect that the paraffin test was
unreliable[C4-670] in determining whether or not a person has fired a
rifle or revolver.[C4-671] The Commission has, therefore, placed no
reliance on the paraffin tests administered by the Dallas police. (See
app. X, pp. 561-562.)

Oswald provided little information during his questioning. Frequently,
however, he was confronted with evidence which he could not explain,
and he resorted to statements which are known to be lies.[C4-672] While
Oswald’s untrue statements during interrogation were not considered
items of positive proof by the Commission, they had probative value in
deciding the weight to be given to his denials that he assassinated
President Kennedy and killed Patrolman Tippit. Since independent
evidence revealed that Oswald repeatedly and blatantly lied to the
police, the Commission gave little weight to his denials of guilt.


Denial of Rifle Ownership

From the outset, Oswald denied owning a rifle. On November 23, Fritz
confronted Oswald with the evidence that he had purchased a rifle under
the fictitious name of “Hidell.” Oswald said that this was not true.
Oswald denied that he had a rifle wrapped up in a blanket in the Paine
garage. Oswald also denied owning a rifle and said that since leaving
the Marine Corps he had fired only a small bore .22 rifle.[C4-673] On
the afternoon of November 23, Officers H. M. Moore, R. S. Stovall, and
G. F. Rose obtained a search warrant and examined Oswald’s effects in
the Paine garage. They discovered two photographs, each showing Oswald
with a rifle and a pistol.[C4-674] These photographs were shown to
Oswald on the evening of November 23 and again on the morning of the
24th. According to Fritz, Oswald sneered, saying that they were fake
photographs, that he had been photographed a number of times the day
before by the police, that they had superimposed upon the photographs
a rifle and a revolver.[C4-675] He told Fritz a number of times that
the smaller photograph was either made from the larger, or the larger
photograph was made from the smaller and that at the proper time he
would show that the pictures were fakes. Fritz told him that the two
small photographs were found in the Paine garage. At that point,
Oswald refused to answer any further questions.[C4-676] As previously
indicated, Marina Oswald testified that she took the two pictures with
her husband’s Imperial Reflex camera when they lived on Neely Street.
Her testimony was fully supported by a photography expert who testified
that in his opinion the pictures were not composites.[C4-677]


The Revolver

At the first interrogation, Oswald claimed that his only crime was
carrying a gun and resisting arrest. When Captain Fritz asked him why
he carried the revolver, he answered, “Well, you know about a pistol.
I just carried it.”[C4-678] He falsely alleged that he bought the
revolver in Fort Worth,[C4-679] when in fact he purchased it from a
mail-order house in Los Angeles.[C4-680]


The Aliases “Hidell” and “O. H. Lee”

The arresting officers found a forged selective service card with
a picture of Oswald and the name “Alek J. Hidell” in Oswald’s
billfold.[C4-681] On November 22 and 23, Oswald refused to tell Fritz
why this card was in his possession,[C4-682] or to answer any questions
concerning the card.[C4-683] On Sunday morning, November 24, Oswald
denied that he knew A. J. Hidell. Captain Fritz produced the selective
service card bearing the name “Alek J. Hidell.” Oswald became angry
and said, “Now, I’ve told you all I’m going to tell you about that
card in my billfold--you have the card yourself and you know as much
about it as I do.”[C4-684] At the last interrogation on November 24,
Oswald admitted to Postal Inspector Holmes that he had rented post
office box 2915, Dallas, but denied that he had received a package
in this box addressed to Hidell. He also denied that he had received
the rifle through this box.[C4-685] Holmes reminded Oswald that A. J.
Hidell was listed on post office box 30061, New Orleans, as one
entitled to receive mail. Oswald replied, “I don’t know anything about
that.”[C4-686]

When asked why he lived at his roominghouse under the name O. H. Lee,
Oswald responded that the landlady simply made a mistake, because he
told her that his name was Lee, meaning his first name.[C4-687] An
examination of the roominghouse register revealed that Oswald actually
signed the name O. H. Lee.[C4-688]


The Curtain Rod Story

In concluding that Oswald was carrying a rifle in the paper bag on the
morning of November 22, 1963, the Commission found that Oswald lied
when he told Frazier that he was returning to Irving to obtain curtain
rods. When asked about the curtain rod story, Oswald lied again. He
denied that he had ever told Frazier that he wanted a ride to Irving
to get curtain rods for an apartment.[C4-689] He explained that a
party for the Paine children had been planned for the weekend and he
preferred not to be in the Paine house at that time; therefore, he made
his weekly visit on Thursday night.[C4-690] Actually, the party for one
of the Paine’s children was the preceding weekend, when Marina Oswald
suggested that Oswald remain in Dallas.[C4-691] When told that Frazier
and Mrs. Randle had seen him carrying a long heavy package, Oswald
replied, “Well, they was mistaken. That must have been some other
time he picked me up.”[C4-692] In one interview, he told Fritz that
the only sack he carried to work that day was a lunch sack which he
kept on his lap during the ride from Irving to Dallas.[C4-693] Frazier
testified before the Commission that Oswald carried no lunch sack that
day.[C4-694]


Actions During and After Shooting

During the first interrogation on November 22, Fritz asked Oswald to
account for himself at the time the President was shot. Oswald told him
that he ate lunch in the first-floor lunchroom and then went to the
second floor for a Coke which he brought downstairs. He acknowledged
the encounter with the police officer on the second floor. Oswald
told Fritz that after lunch he went outside, talked with Foreman Bill
Shelley for 5 or 10 minutes and then left for home. He said that he
left work because Bill Shelley said that there would be no more work
done that day in the building.[C4-695] Shelley denied seeing Oswald
after 12 noon or at any time after the shooting.[C4-696] The next day,
Oswald added to his story. He stated that at the time the President was
shot he was having lunch with “Junior” but he did not give Junior’s
last name.[C4-697] The only employee at the Depository Building named
“Junior” was James Jarman, Jr. Jarman testified that he ate his lunch
on the first floor around 5 minutes to 12, and that he neither ate
lunch with nor saw Oswald.[C4-698] Jarman did talk to Oswald that
morning:

    * * * he asked me what were the people gathering around on the
    corner for and I told him that the President was supposed to
    pass that morning, and he asked me did I know which way he was
    coming, and I told him, yes, he probably come down Main and
    turn on Houston and then back again on Elm. Then he said, “Oh,
    I see,” and that was all.[C4-699]


PRIOR ATTEMPT TO KILL

The Attempt on the Life of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker

At approximately 9 p.m., on April 10, 1963, in Dallas, Tex., Maj. Gen.
Edwin A. Walker, an active and controversial figure on the American
political scene since his resignation from the U.S. Army in 1961,
narrowly escaped death when a rifle bullet fired from outside his
home passed near his head as he was seated at his desk.[C4-700] There
were no eyewitnesses, although a 14-year-old boy in a neighboring
house claimed that immediately after the shooting he saw two men, in
separate cars, drive out of a church parking lot adjacent to Walker’s
home.[C4-701] A friend of Walker’s testified that two nights before the
shooting he saw “two men around the house peeking in windows.”[C4-702]
General Walker gave this information to the police before the shooting,
but it did not help solve the crime. Although the bullet was recovered
from Walker’s house (see app. X, p. 562), in the absence of a weapon
it was of little investigatory value. General Walker hired two
investigators to determine whether a former employee might have been
involved in the shooting.[C4-703] Their results were negative. Until
December 3, 1963, the Walker shooting remained unsolved.

The Commission evaluated the following evidence in considering whether
Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shot which almost killed General Walker:
(1) A note which Oswald left for his wife on the evening of the
shooting, (2) photographs found among Oswald’s possessions after the
assassination of President Kennedy, (3) firearm identification of the
bullet found in Walker’s home, and (4) admissions and other statements
made to Marina Oswald by Oswald concerning the shooting.

_Note left by Oswald._--On December 2, 1963, Mrs. Ruth Paine turned
over to the police some of the Oswalds’ belongings, including a Russian
volume entitled “Book of Useful Advice.”[C4-704] In this book was an
undated note written in Russian. In translation, the note read as
follows:

    1. This is the key to the mailbox which is located in the main
    post office in the city on Ervay Street. This is the same
    street where the drugstore, in which you always waited is
    located. You will find the mailbox in the post office which is
    located 4 blocks from the drugstore on that street. I paid for
    the box last month so don’t worry about it.

    2. Send the information as to what has happened to me to
    the Embassy and include newspaper clippings (should there
    be anything about me in the newspapers). I believe that the
    Embassy will come quickly to your assistance on learning
    everything.

    3. I paid the house rent on the 2d so don’t worry about it.

    4. Recently I also paid for water and gas.

    5. The money from work will possibly be coming. The money will
    be sent to our post office box. Go to the bank and cash the
    check.

    6. You can either throw out or give my clothing, etc. away.
    Do not keep these. However, I prefer that you hold on to my
    personal papers (military, civil, etc.).

    7. Certain of my documents are in the small blue valise.

    8. The address book can be found on my table in the study
    should need same.

    9. We have friends here. The Red Cross also will help you. (Red
    Cross in English). [sic]

    10. I left you as much money as I could, $60 on the second of
    the month. You and the baby [apparently] can live for another 2
    months using $10 per week.

    11. If I am alive and taken prisoner, the city jail is located
    at the end of the bridge through which we always passed on
    going to the city (right in the beginning of the city after
    crossing the bridge).[C4-705]

James C. Cadigan, FBI handwriting expert, testified that this note was
written by Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-706]

Prior to the Walker shooting on April 10, Oswald had been attending
typing classes on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings. He had quit
these classes at least a week before the shooting, which occurred on
a Wednesday night.[C4-707] According to Marina Oswald’s testimony, on
the night of the Walker shooting, her husband left their apartment on
Neely Street shortly after dinner. She thought he was attending a class
or was “on his own business.”[C4-708] When he failed to return by 10
or 10:30 p.m., Marina Oswald went to his room and discovered the note.
She testified: “When he came back I asked him what had happened. He was
very pale. I don’t remember the exact time, but it was very late. And
he told me not to ask him any questions. He only told me he had shot
at General Walker.”[C4-709] Oswald told his wife that he did not know
whether he had hit Walker; according to Marina Oswald when he learned
on the radio and in the newspapers the next day that he had missed,
he said that he “was very sorry that he had not hit him.”[C4-710]
Marina Oswald’s testimony was fully supported by the note itself which
appeared to be the work of a man expecting to be killed, or imprisoned,
or to disappear. The last paragraph directed her to the jail and the
other paragraphs instructed her on the disposal of Oswald’s personal
effects and the management of her affairs if he should not return.

It is clear that the note was written while the Oswalds were living
in Dallas before they moved to New Orleans in the spring of 1963. The
references to house rent and payments for water and gas indicated that
the note was written when they were living in a rented apartment;
therefore it could not have been written while Marina Oswald was living
with the Paines. Moreover, the reference in paragraph 3 to paying “the
house rent on the 2d” would be consistent with the period when the
Oswalds were living on Neely Street since the apartment was rented on
March 3, 1963. Oswald had paid the first month’s rent in advance on
March 2, 1963, and the second month’s rent was paid on either April
2 or April 3.[C4-711] The main post office “on Ervay Street” refers
to the post office where Oswald rented box 2915 from October 9, 1962,
to May 14, 1963.[C4-712] Another statement which limits the time
when it could have been written is the reference “you and the baby,”
which would indicate that it was probably written before the birth of
Oswald’s second child on October 20, 1963.

Oswald had apparently mistaken the county jail for the city jail.
From Neely Street the Oswalds would have traveled downtown on the
Beckley bus, across the Commerce Street viaduct and into downtown
Dallas through the Triple Underpass.[C4-713] Either the viaduct or the
underpass might have been the “bridge” mentioned in the last paragraph
of the note. The county jail is at the corner of Houston and Main
Streets “right in the beginning of the city” after one travels through
the underpass.

_Photographs._--In her testimony before the Commission in February
1964, Marina Oswald stated that when Oswald returned home on the
night of the Walker shooting, he told her that he had been planning
the attempt for 2 months. He showed her a notebook 3 days later
containing photographs of General Walker’s home and a map of the area
where the house was located.[C4-714] Although Oswald destroyed the
notebook,[C4-715] three photographs found among Oswald’s possessions
after the assassination were identified by Marina Oswald as photographs
of General Walker’s house.[C4-716] Two of these photographs were taken
from the rear of Walker’s house.[C4-717] The Commission confirmed, by
comparison with other photographs, that these were, indeed, photographs
of the rear of Walker’s house.[C4-718] An examination of the window at
the rear of the house, the wall through which the bullet passed, and
the fence behind the house indicated that the bullet was fired from a
position near the point where one of the photographs was taken.[C4-719]

The third photograph identified by Marina Oswald depicts the entrance
to General Walker’s driveway from a back alley.[C4-720] Also seen
in the picture is the fence on which Walker’s assailant apparently
rested the rifle.[C4-721] An examination of certain construction work
appearing in the background of this photograph revealed that the
picture was taken between March 8 and 12, 1963, and most probably on
either March 9 or March 10.[C4-722] Oswald purchased the money order
for the rifle on March 12, the rifle was shipped on March 20,[C4-723]
and the shooting occurred on April 10. A photography expert with
the FBI was able to determine that this picture was taken with the
Imperial Reflex camera owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-724] (See app. X,
p. 596.)

A fourth photograph, showing a stretch of railroad tracks, was
also identified by Marina Oswald as having been taken by her
husband, presumably in connection with the Walker shooting.[C4-725]
Investigation determined that this photograph was taken approximately
seven-tenths of a mile from Walker’s house.[C4-726] Another photograph
of railroad tracks found among Oswald’s possessions was not identified
by his wife, but investigation revealed that it was taken from a point
slightly less than half a mile from General Walker’s house.[C4-727]
Marina Oswald stated that when she asked her husband what he had done
with the rifle, he replied that he had buried it in the ground or
hidden it in some bushes and that he also mentioned a railroad track in
this connection. She testified that several days later Oswald recovered
his rifle and brought it back to their apartment.[C4-728]

_Firearms identification._--In the room beyond the one in which General
Walker was sitting on the night of the shooting the Dallas police
recovered a badly mutilated bullet which had come to rest on a stack of
paper.[C4-729] The Dallas City-County Investigation Laboratory tried to
determine the type of weapon which fired the bullet. The oral report
was negative because of the battered condition of the bullet.[C4-730]
On November 30, 1963, the FBI requested the bullet for ballistics
examination; the Dallas Police Department forwarded it on December 2,
1963.[C4-731]

Robert A. Frazier, an FBI ballistics identification expert, testified
that he was “unable to reach a conclusion” as to whether or not the
bullet recovered from Walker’s house had been fired from the rifle
found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building.
He concluded that “the general rifling characteristics of the rifle
* * * are of the same type as those found on the bullet * * * and,
further, on this basis * * * the bullet could have been fired from the
rifle on the basis of its land and groove impressions.”[C4-732] Frazier
testified further that the FBI avoids the category of “probable”
identification. Unless the missile or cartridge case can be identified
as coming from a particular weapon to the exclusion of all others, the
FBI refuses to draw any conclusion as to probability.[C4-733] Frazier
testified, however, that he found no microscopic characteristics or
other evidence which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from
the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle owned by Lee Harvey Oswald. It was a
6.5-millimeter bullet and, according to Frazier, “relatively few” types
of rifles could produce the characteristics found on the bullet.[C4-734]

Joseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal
Identification and Investigation, conducted an independent examination
of this bullet and concluded “that there is a fair probability” that
the bullet was fired from the rifle used in the assassination of
President Kennedy.[C4-735] In explaining the difference between his
policy and that of the FBI on the matter of probable identification,
Nicol said:

    I am aware of their position. This is not, I am sure, arrived
    at without careful consideration. However, to say that because
    one does not find sufficient marks for identification that
    it is a negative, I think is going overboard in the other
    direction. And for purposes of probative value, for whatever
    it might be worth, in the absence of very definite negative
    evidence, I think it is permissible to say that in an exhibit
    such as 573 there is enough on it to say that it could have
    come, and even perhaps a little stronger, to say that it
    probably came from this, without going so far as to say to the
    exclusion of all other guns. This I could not do.[C4-736]

Although the Commission recognizes that neither expert was able to
state that the bullet which missed General Walker was fired from
Oswald’s rifle to the exclusion of all others, this testimony was
considered probative when combined with the other testimony linking
Oswald to the shooting.

_Additional corroborative evidence._--The admissions made to Marina
Oswald by her husband are an important element in the evidence that Lee
Harvey Oswald fired the shot at General Walker. As shown above, the
note and the photographs of Walker’s house and of the nearby railroad
tracks provide important corroboration for her account of the incident.
Other details described by Marina Oswald coincide with facts developed
independently of her statements. She testified that her husband had
postponed his attempt to kill Walker until that Wednesday because he
had heard that there was to be a gathering at the church next door
to Walker’s house on that evening. He indicated that he wanted more
people in the vicinity at the time of the attempt so that his arrival
and departure would not attract great attention.[C4-737] An official
of this church told FBI agents that services are held every Wednesday
at the church except during the month of August.[C4-738] Marina Oswald
also testified that her husband had used a bus to return home.[C4-739]
A study of the bus routes indicates that Oswald could have taken any
one of several different buses to Walker’s house or to a point near the
railroad tracks where he may have concealed the rifle.[C4-740] It would
have been possible for him to take different routes in approaching and
leaving the scene of the shooting.

_Conclusion._--Based on (1) the contents of the note which Oswald
left for his wife on April 10, 1963, (2) the photographs found among
Oswald’s possessions, (3) the testimony of firearms identification
experts, and (4) the testimony of Marina Oswald, the Commission has
concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald attempted to take the life of Maj.
Gen. Edwin A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army) on April 10, 1963. The
finding that Lee Harvey Oswald attempted to murder a public figure in
April 1963 was considered of probative value in this investigation,
although the Commission’s conclusion concerning the identity of the
assassin was based on evidence independent of the finding that Oswald
attempted to kill General Walker.


Richard M. Nixon Incident

Another alleged threat by Oswald against a public figure involved
former Vice President Richard M. Nixon. In January 1964, Marina Oswald
and her business manager, James Martin, told Robert Oswald, Lee Harvey
Oswald’s brother, that Oswald had once threatened to shoot former
Vice President Richard M. Nixon.[C4-741] When Marina Oswald testified
before the Commission on February 3-6, 1964, she had failed to mention
the incident when she was asked whether Oswald had ever expressed
any hostility toward any official of the United States.[C4-742] The
Commission first learned of this incident when Robert Oswald related it
to FBI agents on February 19, 1964,[C4-743] and to the Commission on
February 21.[C4-744]

Marina Oswald appeared before the Commission again on June 11, 1964,
and testified that a few days before her husband’s departure from
Dallas to New Orleans on April 24, 1963, he finished reading a morning
newspaper “* * * and put on a good suit. I saw that he took a pistol.
I asked him where he was going, and why he was getting dressed. He
answered ‘Nixon is coming. I want to go and have a look.’” He also said
that he would use the pistol if the opportunity arose.[C4-745] She
reminded him that after the Walker shooting he had promised never to
repeat such an act. Marina Oswald related the events which followed:

    I called him into the bathroom and I closed the door and I
    wanted to prevent him and then I started to cry. And I told him
    that he shouldn’t do this, and that he had promised me.

       *       *       *       *       *

    I remember that I held him. We actually struggled for several
    minutes and then he quieted down.[C4-746]

She stated that it was not physical force which kept him from leaving
the house. “I couldn’t keep him from going out if he really wanted
to.”[C4-747] After further questioning she stated that she might have
been confused about shutting him in the bathroom, but that “there is no
doubt that he got dressed and got a gun.”[C4-748]

Oswald’s revolver was shipped from Los Angeles on March 20,
1963,[C4-749] and he left for New Orleans on April 24, 1963.[C4-750]
No edition of either Dallas newspaper during the period January 1,
1963, to May 15, 1963, mentioned any proposed visit by Mr. Nixon to
Dallas.[C4-751] Mr. Nixon advised the Commission that the only time
he was in Dallas in 1963 was on November 20-21, 1963.[C4-752] An
investigation failed to reveal any invitation extended to Mr. Nixon
during the period when Oswald’s threat reportedly occurred.[C4-753] The
Commission has concluded, therefore, that regardless of what Oswald may
have said to his wife he was not actually planning to shoot Mr. Nixon
at that time in Dallas.

On April 23, 1963, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was in Dallas for
a visit which had been publicized in the Dallas newspapers throughout
April.[C4-754] The Commission asked Marina Oswald whether she might
have misunderstood the object of her husband’s threat. She stated,
“there is no question that in this incident it was a question of
Mr. Nixon.”[C4-755] When asked later whether it might have been Mr.
Johnson, she said, “Yes, no. I am getting a little confused with so
many questions. I was absolutely convinced it was Nixon and now after
all these questions I wonder if I am right in my mind.”[C4-756] She
stated further that Oswald had only mentioned Nixon’s name once during
the incident.[C4-757] Marina Oswald might have misunderstood her
husband. Mr. Johnson was the then Vice President and his visit took
place on April 23d.[C4-758] This was 1 day before Oswald left for New
Orleans and Marina appeared certain that the Nixon incident “wasn’t the
day before. Perhaps 3 days before.”[C4-759]

Marina Oswald speculated that the incident may have been unrelated to
an actual threat. She said,

    * * * It might have been that he was just trying to test me.
    He was the kind of person who could try and wound somebody in
    that way. Possibly he didn’t want to go out at all but was just
    doing this all as a sort of joke, not really as a joke but
    rather to simply wound me, to make me feel bad.[C4-760]

In the absence of other evidence that Oswald actually intended
to shoot someone at this time, the Commission concluded that the
incident, as described by Marina Oswald, was of no probative value in
the Commission’s decision concerning the identity of the assassin of
President Kennedy.


OSWALD’S RIFLE CAPABILITY

In deciding whether Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots which killed
President Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally, the Commission
considered whether Oswald, using his own rifle, possessed the
capability to hit his target with two out of three shots under the
conditions described in chapter III. The Commission evaluated (1) the
nature of the shots, (2) Oswald’s Marine training in marksmanship, (3)
his experience and practice after leaving the Marine Corps, and (4) the
accuracy of the weapon and the quality of the ammunition.


The Nature of the Shots

For a rifleman situated on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book
Depository Building the shots were at a slow-moving target proceeding
on a downgrade in virtually a straight line with the alinement of the
assassin’s rifle, at a range of 177 to 266 feet.[C4-761] An aerial
photograph of Dealey Plaza shows that Elm Street runs at an angle so
that the President would have been moving in an almost straight line
away from the assassin’s rifle.[C4-762] (See Commission Exhibit No.
876, p. 33.) In addition, the 3° downward slope of Elm Street was of
assistance in eliminating at least some of the adjustment which is
ordinarily required when a marksman must raise his rifle as a target
moves farther away.[C4-763]

Four marksmanship experts testified before the Commission. Maj.
Eugene D. Anderson, assistant head of the Marksmanship Branch of
the U.S. Marine Corps, testified that the shots which struck the
President in the neck and in the head were “not * * * particularly
difficult.”[C4-764] Robert A. Frazier, FBI expert in firearms
identification and training, said:

    From my own experience in shooting over the years, when you
    shoot at 175 feet or 260 feet, which is less than 100 yards,
    with a telescopic sight, you should not have any difficulty in
    hitting your target.

       *       *       *       *       *

    I mean it requires no training at all to shoot a weapon with a
    telescopic sight once you know that you must put the crosshairs
    on the target and that is all that is necessary.[C4-765]

Ronald Simmons, chief of the U.S. Army Infantry Weapons Evaluation
Branch of the Ballistics Research Laboratory, said: “Well, in order
to achieve three hits, it would not be required that a man be an
exceptional shot. A proficient man with this weapon, yes.”[C4-766]

The effect of a four-power telescopic sight on the difficulty of
these shots was considered in detail by M. Sgt. James A. Zahm,
noncommissioned officer in charge of the Marksmanship Training Unit in
the Weapons Training Battalion of the Marine Corps School at Quantico,
Va.[C4-767] Referring to a rifle with a four-power telescope, Sergeant
Zahm said:

    * * * this is the ideal type of weapon for moving
    targets * * *[C4-768]

       *       *       *       *       *

    * * * Using the scope, rapidly working a bolt and using the
    scope to relocate your target quickly and at the same time when
    you locate that target you identify it and the crosshairs are
    in close relationship to the point you want to shoot at, it
    just takes a minor move in aiming to bring the crosshairs to
    bear, and then it is a quick squeeze.[C4-769]

       *       *       *       *       *

    I consider it a real advantage, particularly at the range of
    100 yards, in identifying your target. It allows you to see
    your target clearly, and it is still of a minimum amount of
    power that it doesn’t exaggerate your own body movements. It
    just is an aid in seeing in the fact that you only have the one
    element, the crosshair, in relation to the target as opposed to
    iron sights with aligning the sights and then aligning them on
    the target.[C4-770]

Characterizing the four-power scope as “a real aid, an extreme aid”
in rapid fire shooting, Sergeant Zahm expressed the opinion that the
shot which struck President Kennedy in the neck at 176.9 to 190.8 feet
was “very easy” and the shot which struck the President in the head
at a distance of 265.3 feet was “an easy shot.”[C4-771] After viewing
photographs depicting the alinement of Elm Street in relation to the
Texas School Book Depository Building, Zahm stated further:

    This is a definite advantage to the shooter, the vehicle moving
    directly away from him and the downgra
