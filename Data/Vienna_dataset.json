                "The history of Vienna has been long and varied, beginning when the Roman Empire created a military camp in the area now covered by Vienna's city centre. Vienna grew from the Roman settlement known as Vindobona to be an important trading site in the 11th century. It became the capital of the Babenberg dynasty and subsequently of the Austrian Habsburgs, under whom it became one of Europe's cultural hubs. During the 19th century as the capital of the Austrian Empire and later Austria-Hungary, it temporarily became one of Europe's biggest cities. Since the end of World War I, Vienna has been the capital of the Republic of Austria.\n\n\n== Beginnings and early Middle Ages ==\n\nThe name Vindobona derives from a Celtic language, suggesting that the region must have been inhabited before Roman times. The Romans created a military camp (occupied by Legio X Gemina) during the 1st century on the site of the city centre of present-day Vienna. The settlement was raised to the status of a municipium in 212. Even today, the streets of the First District show where the encampment placed its walls and moats. The Romans stayed until the 5th century.\nRoman Vindobona was located in the outskirts of the empire and thus fell prey to the chaos of the Migration Period. There are some indications that a catastrophic fire occurred around the beginning of the 5th century. However, the remains of the encampment were not deserted, and a small settlement remained. The streets and houses of early medieval Vienna followed the former Roman walls, which gives rise to the conclusion that parts of the fortification were still in place and used by the settlers.\nByzantine copper coins from the 6th century have been found several times in the area of today's city centre, indicating considerable trade activity. Graves from the 6th century were found during excavations next to the Berghof, in an area around Salvatorgasse. At that time, the Lombards controlled the area, with Slavs and Avars following later. Early Vienna was  centred on the Berghof.\nThe first documented mention of the city during the Middle Ages is within the Salzburg Annals, dating to 881, when a battle apud Weniam was fought against the Magyars. However, it is unclear whether this refers to the city or the River Wien.\n\n\n== Babenberg rule ==\n\nIn 976, the Margraviate of Ostarr\u00eechi was given to the Babenberg family. Vienna lay at its border with Hungary.\nVienna was an important site of trade as early as the 11th century. In the Exchange of Mautern between the Bishop of Passau and Margrave Leopold IV, Vienna is mentioned as a Civitas for the first time, which indicates the existence of a well-ordered settlement. \nIn 1155, Margrave Henry II of Austria made Vienna his capital. In 1156, Austria was raised to a duchy in the Privilegium Minus, with Vienna becoming the seat of all future dukes. During that time, the Schottenstift was founded.\nThe events surrounding the Third Crusade, during which King Richard the Lionheart was discovered and captured by Duke Leopold V the Virtuous two days before Christmas of 1192 in Erdberg near Vienna, brought an enormous ransom of 50,000 Silver Marks (about 10 to 12 tons of silver, about a third of the emperor's claims against the English. Richard had been extradited to him in March 1193). This allowed the creation of a mint and the construction of city walls around the year 1200. At the U-Bahn station Stubentor, some remains of the city walls can still be seen today. Because he had abused a protected crusader, Leopold V was excommunicated by Pope Celestine III, and died (without having been absolved) after falling from a horse in a tournament.\nIn 1221, Vienna received the rights of a city and as a staple port (Stapelrecht). This meant that all traders passing through Vienna had to offer their goods in the city. This allowed the Viennese to act as middlemen in trade, so that Vienna soon created a network of far-reaching trade relations, particularly along the Danube basin and to Venice, and to become one of the most important cities in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHowever, it was considered embarrassing that Vienna did not have its own bishop.

            "reference_answer": "The year 1155 is significant in the history of Vienna as it marks the moment when Margrave Henry II of Austria made Vienna his capital. This decision was pivotal for the city's development under the Babenberg dynasty for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, by establishing Vienna as the capital, Henry II elevated its status from a regional settlement to a central political hub. This move not only solidified the Babenberg family's power but also positioned Vienna as a focal point for governance and administration in the region. As the seat of the dukes, Vienna became the center of political activity, which attracted nobility, merchants, and artisans, fostering economic growth and urban development.\n\nSecondly, the elevation of Vienna to capital status coincided with the raising of Austria to a duchy in 1156 through the Privilegium Minus. This change further enhanced Vienna's importance, as it became the administrative heart of the newly established duchy. The presence of the ducal court and the associated administrative functions stimulated the local economy and encouraged the establishment of institutions that would support trade and commerce.\n\nAdditionally, the Babenberg dynasty's focus on Vienna led to significant infrastructural developments. The city began to grow in size and complexity, with the construction of city walls and other fortifications around the year 1200, which were essential for protecting the burgeoning population and trade activities. The establishment of a mint following the capture of King Richard the Lionheart during the Third Crusade also contributed to the city's economic prosperity, allowing Vienna to engage more actively in trade.\n\nIn summary, the year 1155 was a turning point for Vienna, as it became the capital of the Babenberg dynasty. This status not only enhanced its political significance but also laid the groundwork for economic growth, urban development, and the establishment of vital trade networks, ultimately shaping Vienna into one of the most important cities in the Holy Roman Empire.",

            "reference_answer": "The granting of city rights and staple port status to Vienna in 1221 had significant implications for its development and role in trade within the Holy Roman Empire. \n\nFirstly, receiving city rights meant that Vienna was recognized as a self-governing entity with certain privileges, which included the ability to establish its own laws and governance structures. This autonomy allowed Vienna to develop a more organized and structured urban environment, fostering a sense of community and stability that was attractive to traders and settlers.\n\nThe staple port status (Stapelrecht) was particularly crucial for Vienna's economic growth. It mandated that all traders passing through the city had to offer their goods for sale there before continuing on their journeys. This requirement positioned Vienna as a central hub in trade networks, allowing it to act as a middleman in the exchange of goods. As a result, the city became a vital point for commerce, facilitating trade not only along the Danube basin but also extending to Venice and beyond.\n\nThis enhanced trade activity contributed to Vienna's emergence as one of the most important cities in the Holy Roman Empire. The influx of goods and merchants led to increased economic prosperity, which in turn attracted more people to the city, further boosting its population and economic significance. The establishment of a network of far-reaching trade relations helped Vienna to solidify its status as a cultural and economic center in the region.\n\nIn summary, the rights granted to Vienna in 1221 transformed it into a key player in the trade dynamics of the Holy Roman Empire, fostering economic growth, urban development, and a strategic position in regional commerce.",

Although the city managed to withstand the siege, it became evident that the existing fortifications were inadequate to repel a determined and well-equipped enemy. The siege highlighted the need for modernized defenses, as the city's defenses barely held against the Turkish attacks, which were exacerbated by epidemics and harsh winter conditions that forced the Ottomans to retreat.\n\nIn response to the vulnerabilities exposed during the First Siege, significant improvements were made to Vienna's fortifications. By 1548, under the guidance of military architect Sebastian Schrantz, the city was transformed into a formidable fortress. This included the construction of eleven bastions, a surrounding moat, and a glacis\u2014a clear area that allowed defenders to fire upon attackers without obstruction.

                "=== 18th century ===\n\nThe following period was characterised by extensive building activities. In the course of reconstruction, Vienna was largely turned into a baroque city. The most important architects were Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. Most construction happened in the suburbs (Vorst\u00e4dte), as the nobility began to cover the surrounding land with garden palaces, known as Palais. The best known are the Palais Liechtenstein, Palais Modena, Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, Palais Schwarzenberg, and the Belvedere (the garden palais of Prince Eugene of Savoy). In 1704, an outer fortification, the Linienwall, was built around the Vorst\u00e4dte.\nAfter the extensive plague epidemics of 1679 and 1713, the population began to grow steadily. It is estimated that 150,000 people lived in Vienna in 1724, and 200,000 in 1790. At that time, the first factories were built, starting in Leopoldstadt. Leopoldstadt also became a site where many Jews lived, as they had been driven out of their 50-year-old ghetto in 1670. Hygienic problems began to become noticeable: sewers and street cleaning began to develop. Also in this time, the first house numbers (the Konskriptionsnummern) were issued, and the government postal system began to develop.\nUnder Emperor Joseph II, the city administration was modernized in 1783: officials in charge of only the city were introduced, and the Magistrate was created (More information about the Magistrate of the City of Vienna specifically can be found in German at de:Magistrat der Stadt Wien.). At the same time, the graveyards within the city were closed.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, Vienna was taken by the French twice, in 1805 and 1809. The first conquest happened without a battle. Three French marshals crossed the strongly defended Taborbr\u00fccke (T\u00e1bor bridge), the only Danube bridge at that time, and convinced the Austrian commander that the war was already over. In the meantime, the French army easily entered the city and was greeted by the population with interest rather than rejection. Napoleon allowed 10,000 men of the Vienna national guard to remain armed and left the arsenal to them when he left, as complete as he had found it.\nHowever, the second occupation happened only after heavy fire. Shortly after, Napoleon suffered his first large defeat at Aspern, nearby. Less than two months later, his army crossed the Danube again and fought the Battle of Wagram on the same terrain as the previous Battle of Aspern. This second battle resulted in a victory for the French, and Austria soon surrendered, ending the War of the Fifth Coalition. In 1810, Salomon Mayer Rothschild arrived in Vienna from Frankfurt and sets up a bank named \"Mayer von Rothschild und S\u00f6hne\". The Emperor of Austria in 1823, made the five Rothschild brothers barons. The Rothschild family became famous as bankers in the major countries of Europe, and the Rothschild banking family of Austria remained prominent until the Creditanstalt bank in Vienna was confiscated by the Nazis in 1938.\nAfter Napoleon's final defeat, the Congress of Vienna took place from September 18, 1814 to June 9, 1815, in which the political map of Europe was redrawn.

            "reference_answer": "Emperor Joseph II's administration reforms in 1783 had a significant impact on the city of Vienna, particularly in the areas of urban management and public health. One of the key changes was the modernization of the city administration, which involved the introduction of officials specifically responsible for managing the city. This restructuring led to the establishment of the Magistrate, an administrative body that played a crucial role in overseeing various aspects of urban life.\n\nThe reforms aimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of governance in Vienna, which was becoming increasingly important as the population grew and urban issues became more pronounced. With an estimated population of 200,000 by 1790, the city faced challenges related to infrastructure, sanitation, and public health. The introduction of a dedicated city administration allowed for more focused attention on these issues.\n\nIn terms of public health, the reforms coincided with the growing recognition of hygienic problems in the city. The previous extensive plague epidemics had highlighted the need for better sanitation and health measures. Under Joseph II's administration, efforts began to develop sewers and improve street cleaning, which were essential for reducing the spread of disease and improving the overall living conditions in Vienna.\n\nAdditionally, the closure of graveyards within the city limits was a significant public health measure. This action not only addressed the health risks associated with overcrowded burial sites but also reflected a shift towards more modern urban planning practices that prioritized the well-being of residents.\n\nOverall, Emperor Joseph II's reforms laid the groundwork for a more organized and health-conscious approach to urban management in Vienna, addressing the pressing needs of a growing population and setting the stage for further developments in public health and city planning in the years to come.",

                "=== 18th century ===\n\nThe following period was characterised by extensive building activities. In the course of reconstruction, Vienna was largely turned into a baroque city. The most important architects were Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. Most construction happened in the suburbs (Vorst\u00e4dte), as the nobility began to cover the surrounding land with garden palaces, known as Palais. The best known are the Palais Liechtenstein, Palais Modena, Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, Palais Schwarzenberg, and the Belvedere (the garden palais of Prince Eugene of Savoy). In 1704, an outer fortification, the Linienwall, was built around the Vorst\u00e4dte.\nAfter the extensive plague epidemics of 1679 and 1713, the population began to grow steadily. It is estimated that 150,000 people lived in Vienna in 1724, and 200,000 in 1790. At that time, the first factories were built, starting in Leopoldstadt. Leopoldstadt also became a site where many Jews lived, as they had been driven out of their 50-year-old ghetto in 1670. Hygienic problems began to become noticeable: sewers and street cleaning began to develop. Also in this time, the first house numbers (the Konskriptionsnummern) were issued, and the government postal system began to develop.\nUnder Emperor Joseph II, the city administration was modernized in 1783: officials in charge of only the city were introduced, and the Magistrate was created (More information about the Magistrate of the City of Vienna specifically can be found in German at de:Magistrat der Stadt Wien.). At the same time, the graveyards within the city were closed.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, Vienna was taken by the French twice, in 1805 and 1809. The first conquest happened without a battle. Three French marshals crossed the strongly defended Taborbr\u00fccke (T\u00e1bor bridge), the only Danube bridge at that time, and convinced the Austrian commander that the war was already over. In the meantime, the French army easily entered the city and was greeted by the population with interest rather than rejection. Napoleon allowed 10,000 men of the Vienna national guard to remain armed and left the arsenal to them when he left, as complete as he had found it.\nHowever, the second occupation happened only after heavy fire. Shortly after, Napoleon suffered his first large defeat at Aspern, nearby. Less than two months later, his army crossed the Danube again and fought the Battle of Wagram on the same terrain as the previous Battle of Aspern. This second battle resulted in a victory for the French, and Austria soon surrendered, ending the War of the Fifth Coalition. In 1810, Salomon Mayer Rothschild arrived in Vienna from Frankfurt and sets up a bank named \"Mayer von Rothschild und S\u00f6hne\". The Emperor of Austria in 1823, made the five Rothschild brothers barons. The Rothschild family became famous as bankers in the major countries of Europe, and the Rothschild banking family of Austria remained prominent until the Creditanstalt bank in Vienna was confiscated by the Nazis in 1938.\nAfter Napoleon's final defeat, the Congress of Vienna took place from September 18, 1814 to June 9, 1815, in which the political map of Europe was redrawn. The congress members indulged in many social events, which induced the witty Charles Joseph, Prince de Ligne to famously say: Le congres danse beaucoup, mais il ne marche pas (\"The congress dances, but does not progress\"). The events cost Austria a great deal of money, which was reflected in mockery about the major participants:\n\nAlexander of Russia: loves for all\nFrederick William of Prussia: thinks for all\nFrederick of Denmark: speaks for all\nMaximilian of Bavaria: drinks for all\nFrederick of W\u00fcrttemberg: eats for all\nEmperor Francis of Austria: pays for all\n\nThe first half of the century was characterised by intensive industrialization, with Vienna being the center of the railway network after 1837.\nThe French February Revolution of 1848 had an effect as far away as Vienna: on March 13, the March Revolution, which forced long-serving chancellor Metternich to resign.\nDuring the 19th century, Vienna, along with Budapest, became one of the main centers of the Aromanian diaspora.

            "reference_answer": "The Congress of Vienna, held from September 18, 1814, to June 9, 1815, was a pivotal event in reshaping the political landscape of Europe following the Napoleonic Wars. Its significance lies in several key areas:\n\n1. **Redrawing the Political Map**: The Congress aimed to restore stability and order to Europe after the upheaval caused by Napoleon's conquests. The major powers\u2014Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain\u2014worked together to redraw national boundaries, ensuring a balance of power that would prevent any single nation from dominating Europe as France had under Napoleon. This involved restoring monarchies and creating a framework for diplomatic relations that would influence European politics for decades.\n\n2. **Restoration of Monarchies**: The Congress sought to reinstate the traditional monarchies that had been overthrown or weakened during the revolutionary period. This restoration was significant for Austria, as it reinforced the Habsburg monarchy's influence in Central Europe and helped to stabilize the region.\n\n3. **Formation of Alliances**: The Congress established a system of alliances and agreements among the great powers, which aimed to maintain peace and prevent future conflicts. This diplomatic framework laid the groundwork for future international relations and was a precursor to later organizations aimed at collective security.\n\n4. **Cultural and Social Impact**: The Congress was not only a political event but also a social one, characterized by lavish balls and gatherings. This aspect highlighted the importance of diplomacy and social interaction among the elite, which was a departure from the more militaristic approaches of the past.\n\nIn terms of Austria's financial situation, the Congress had significant implications:\n\n1. **Financial Burden**: The costs associated with hosting the Congress and the extensive diplomatic activities drained Austria's finances. The lavish expenditures on social events and the logistics of accommodating delegates from various nations placed a heavy financial burden on the Austrian treasury.\n\n2. **Economic Strain**: The financial strain was compounded by the need to maintain a strong military presence to enforce the decisions made at the Congress and to protect Austria's interests in the newly established order. This led to increased taxation and economic challenges for the Austrian populace.\n\n3. **Long-term Consequences**: The financial difficulties experienced by Austria in the aftermath of the Congress contributed to social unrest and political challenges in the following decades. The economic strain was one of the factors that fueled revolutionary sentiments, culminating in events like the March Revolution of 1848.\n\nIn summary, the Congress of Vienna was significant for its role in reshaping Europe's political landscape by establishing a balance of power and restoring monarchies. However, it also had adverse effects on Austria's financial situation, leading to economic strain and contributing to future political instability.",

The Vorst\u00e4dte thus became the 2nd to 9th districts, with the old city becoming the first. In 1858, the fortifications were demolished, and the broad Ringstra\u00dfe boulevard was built in their place. Many monumental buildings were built alongside it. The Ringstra\u00dfe Style (Historicism) characterises the architecture of Vienna to this day. The period peaked in the World Exhibition of 1873, immediately before the stock market crash, which ended the Gr\u00fcnderzeit (\"foundation era\").\nIn 1861, the Liberals won the first (relatively) free elections after the end of neoabsolutism.\nAfter the great flood of 1830, Regulation of the Danube was frequently considered. It was finally put into practice during the 1860s. The many branches of the Danube were removed, and a straight course was created away from the city centre. The branch near the central city was made narrower and has been known under the somewhat misleading name Donaukanal (Danube Canal) ever since.\nDuring that period, the population of Vienna increased sharply, mostly because of immigration. Censuses were conducted regularly from 1869 onwards, which showed an all-time high of population in 1910, with 2,031,000 inhabitants.\nAround 1900, Vienna became a centre of the Jugendstil (Art Nouveau), most of all with Otto Wagner and the association of artists known as Vienna Secession (after which the characteristic building on Karlsplatz is named).\nIn 1890, the city was expanded for a second time: the (Vororte) suburbs beyond the old Linienwall  were incorporated into the town as the districts 11 to 19 (the 10th district had been created in 1874 by the division of the fourth). Leopoldstadt was divided in 1900, with the northern part becoming the 20th district (Brigittenau). In 1904, Floridsdorf became part of Vienna as 21st district.\nDuring those years, Karl Lueger was the leading figure of city politics. Neither his dedication to social policy can be denied, nor other works for the municipality (such as the Wiener Hochquellwasserleitung, bringing fresh water from the mountains to Vienna and the creation of a belt of meadows and forests around the city). However, these positive aspects were coupled with his raving and rhetorically well presented anti-Semitism, which enjoyed popular support.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\nWorld War I (1914\u20131918) did not result in an immediate threat to Vienna, but it led to a lack of supplies because of the economic embargo imposed by the Entente powers, which resulted in a shortage of food and clothes. The skyrocketing costs of the war, mostly financed by borrowing, resulted in tremendous inflation that\u2014as in Germany\u2014wiped out the savings of many middle-class Viennese. One interesting quirk is that the 1916 Rent Control was never officially repealed; even today there are buildings where the 1916 rent\u2014by now essentially meaningless\u2014applies.\nThese food shortages led to the 1918 Austro-Hungarian January Strike which started in Vienna. The Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia in November 1917 inspired the youth wing of the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria to organise meetings in November 1917 opposing the war.\nThe Flight over Vienna propaganda flight, an air raid inspired by Gabriele d'Annunzio, was carried out on August 9, 1918, with 11 Ansaldo SVA.

            "reference_answer": "The expansion of Vienna under Emperor Franz Joseph I during the 19th century had a profound impact on both the population and urban development of the city. This period was marked by significant changes that shaped Vienna's architectural landscape and demographic profile.\n\nOne of the most notable developments was the expansion of the city in 1850, which incorporated the Vorst\u00e4dte (suburbs) into the urban framework, creating districts 2 to 9, while the old city remained the first district. This expansion was a response to the rapid population growth driven largely by immigration. The regular censuses conducted from 1869 onwards revealed a dramatic increase in the population, peaking at 2,031,000 inhabitants in 1910. This surge in population necessitated the development of infrastructure and housing, leading to a more densely populated urban environment.\n\nThe construction of the Ringstra\u00dfe boulevard, initiated in 1858 after the demolition of the old fortifications, was a pivotal moment in Vienna's urban development. This broad boulevard became a symbol of the city's modernization and was lined with monumental buildings that showcased the Ringstra\u00dfe Style, characterized by Historicism. The architectural developments along the Ringstra\u00dfe not only transformed the aesthetic of the city but also reflected the cultural aspirations of the time, culminating in the grandeur of the 1873 World Exhibition. The Ringstra\u00dfe became a central artery of Vienna, influencing urban planning and serving as a model for future developments.\n\nAdditionally, the incorporation of suburbs into the city in 1890 further expanded Vienna's boundaries, creating districts 11 to 21. This integration allowed for the growth of residential areas and contributed to the city's demographic diversity. The suburbs provided space for the burgeoning population, accommodating various social classes and contributing to the city's vibrant cultural tapestry.\n\nThe period also saw Vienna emerge as a center for artistic movements, particularly Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) around 1900, with influential figures like Otto Wagner leading the charge. The architectural innovations during this time were not only a response to the growing population but also a reflection of the city's evolving identity as a cultural hub.\n\nIn summary, the expansion of Vienna under Emperor Franz Joseph I significantly influenced the city's architecture and demographics. The construction of the Ringstra\u00dfe and the incorporation of suburbs facilitated urban growth, shaped the architectural landscape, and contributed to a diverse and rapidly growing population, ultimately transforming Vienna into a modern metropolis.",

This scarcity created a dire situation for the population, particularly affecting the middle class, who were already struggling due to the war's financial burdens. The costs of the war were largely financed through borrowing, which resulted in rampant inflation. This inflation eroded the savings of many middle-class Viennese, leaving them financially vulnerable and exacerbating their hardships. \n\nAs the economic situation deteriorated, the middle class found themselves increasingly discontented.

                "== The First Republic ==\n\nThe end of the war was also the end of Austria-Hungary. On November 12, 1918, the Republic of Deutsch-\u00d6sterreich, or German-Austria, was proclaimed in front of the parliament. The population was concentrated in the capital, which was often called a hydrocephalus because of this;  articles in the international press had doubts about the viability of Vienna as a major European metropolis after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary.\nIn 1921, Vienna was separated from surrounding Lower Austria and became a state of its own, with the mayor now equivalent in rank to a state governor. However, it remained the nominal capital of Lower Austria until 1986. The left-wing Social Democrats, who had dominated since the end of the war, were now in charge of the city administration. \"Red Vienna\" was considered an international model. Many notable Gemeindebauten (low-cost residential estates) were built during that period.\nHowever, the increasing economic difficulties resulted in a political radicalization and polarisation of the political parties. On the social democratic side, the left-wing Republikanische Schutzbund (Republican Protective Alliance) was formed in 1923/24, which was a well-organised and well-equipped paramilitary group. It was opposed by the right-wing Heimwehr (\"Home Guard\"), which had been formed after the end of the war from local guards and similar combat units.\nIn May 1923, in the presence of President Michael Hainisch, the First World Congress of Jewish Women was inaugurated at the Hofburg.\n\n\n== Austrofascism ==\n\nThe fire of the Justizpalast (Palace of Justice) in 1927 after violent demonstrations, the collapse of the Creditanstalt, the largest bank of the country, and finally the dissolution of parliament in 1933, marked the way to the Civil War in February 1934. After Engelbert Dollfu\u00df, who had been Chancellor of Austria and foreign minister since 1932, had forbidden the Nazi Party, the Communist Party and the Schutzbund in 1933, he extended the ban to the Social Democratic Party in 1934 after the February Uprising. The only legal political organization was the new movement of his own creation, the Vaterl\u00e4ndische Front. Dollfu\u00df created an authoritarian regime called St\u00e4ndestaat and ruled without parliamentary approval (also see Austrofascism).\n\n\n== Annexation by Nazi Germany and Second World War ==\n\nIn March 1938 Nazi Germany occupied and annexed Austria in a process known as the Anschluss. Adolf Hitler was rapturously received in Vienna by large crowds of admirers and famously gave a speech at Heldenplatz in which he welcomed his homeland into the Reich. Hitler's anti-Jewish policies fell on fertile soil in Vienna, where latent anti-Semitism had increased during the early 20th century. Immediately after the Anschluss the Jews of Vienna were subject to violence from the State as well as from Antisemites acting out of their own sadism. During the Reichskristallnacht on November 9, 1938, the synagogues, the Jewish centres of not only religious, but also social life, were destroyed. In August, the KZ Oberlanzendorf Wien (Central Office for Jewish Emigration) was created. Its head was Adolf Eichmann. On the whole, and despite some instances of anti-Semitism, the city of Vienna was less supportive of the Nazi regime than was the rest of Austria. This however did not reach any extent of an organised resistance. Hitler himself hated Vienna and was determined to build up Linz, his childhood hometown, and relegate Vienna to backwater status.\nIn the course of the expansion of the city in 1938, 91 adjoining municipalities were incorporated into the city, from which the 22nd (Gro\u00df-Enzersdorf), the 23rd (Schwechat), the 24th (M\u00f6dling), the 25th (Liesing) and the 26th (Klosterneuburg) districts were created. With an area of 1,224 km2, this made Vienna the city with the largest territory in the Third Reich."

            "reference_answer": "After the end of World War I, significant political changes unfolded in Vienna, particularly with the establishment of the Republic of Deutsch-\u00d6sterreich (German-Austria) on November 12, 1918. This proclamation marked the transition from the Austro-Hungarian Empire to a new republican form of governance. The political landscape was characterized by a concentration of the population in Vienna, which raised concerns about the city's viability as a major European metropolis in the wake of the empire's dissolution.\n\nIn 1921, Vienna was officially separated from Lower Austria and became a state in its own right, with the mayor holding a rank equivalent to that of a state governor. This change in status allowed for more localized governance and administration. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), which had been a dominant force since the end of the war, played a crucial role in shaping the city's administration. The period known as \"Red Vienna\" emerged, during which the Social Democrats implemented progressive social policies and urban reforms that aimed to address the needs of the working class.\n\nUnder the leadership of the Social Democrats, Vienna became a model for social housing and welfare programs. The construction of Gemeindebauten, or low-cost residential estates, was a hallmark of this era, providing affordable housing to many citizens and improving living conditions. The SDP's focus on social welfare, education, and public health reflected their commitment to creating a more equitable society.\n\nHowever, the political landscape began to shift as economic difficulties arose, leading to increased polarization among political parties. The rise of paramilitary groups, such as the left-wing Republikanische Schutzbund and the right-wing Heimwehr, indicated a growing tension and radicalization within the political sphere. The Social Democrats' dominance faced challenges, culminating in the authoritarian regime established by Engelbert Dollfu\u00df in the early 1930s, which ultimately suppressed the SDP and other political organizations.\n\nIn summary, the establishment of the Republic of Deutsch-\u00d6sterreich and the subsequent rise of the Social Democrats significantly transformed Vienna's political and social landscape. The city's administration became more focused on social welfare and urban development, but these advancements were eventually undermined by economic challenges and political repression, leading to a more authoritarian governance structure in the years that followed.",

                "== The First Republic ==\n\nThe end of the war was also the end of Austria-Hungary. On November 12, 1918, the Republic of Deutsch-\u00d6sterreich, or German-Austria, was proclaimed in front of the parliament. The population was concentrated in the capital, which was often called a hydrocephalus because of this;  articles in the international press had doubts about the viability of Vienna as a major European metropolis after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary.\nIn 1921, Vienna was separated from surrounding Lower Austria and became a state of its own, with the mayor now equivalent in rank to a state governor. However, it remained the nominal capital of Lower Austria until 1986. The left-wing Social Democrats, who had dominated since the end of the war, were now in charge of the city administration. \"Red Vienna\" was considered an international model. Many notable Gemeindebauten (low-cost residential estates) were built during that period.\nHowever, the increasing economic difficulties resulted in a political radicalization and polarisation of the political parties. On the social democratic side, the left-wing Republikanische Schutzbund (Republican Protective Alliance) was formed in 1923/24, which was a well-organised and well-equipped paramilitary group. It was opposed by the right-wing Heimwehr (\"Home Guard\"), which had been formed after the end of the war from local guards and similar combat units.\nIn May 1923, in the presence of President Michael Hainisch, the First World Congress of Jewish Women was inaugurated at the Hofburg.\n\n\n== Austrofascism ==\n\nThe fire of the Justizpalast (Palace of Justice) in 1927 after violent demonstrations, the collapse of the Creditanstalt, the largest bank of the country, and finally the dissolution of parliament in 1933, marked the way to the Civil War in February 1934. After Engelbert Dollfu\u00df, who had been Chancellor of Austria and foreign minister since 1932, had forbidden the Nazi Party, the Communist Party and the Schutzbund in 1933, he extended the ban to the Social Democratic Party in 1934 after the February Uprising. The only legal political organization was the new movement of his own creation, the Vaterl\u00e4ndische Front. Dollfu\u00df created an authoritarian regime called St\u00e4ndestaat and ruled without parliamentary approval (also see Austrofascism).\n\n\n== Annexation by Nazi Germany and Second World War ==\n\nIn March 1938 Nazi Germany occupied and annexed Austria in a process known as the Anschluss. Adolf Hitler was rapturously received in Vienna by large crowds of admirers and famously gave a speech at Heldenplatz in which he welcomed his homeland into the Reich. Hitler's anti-Jewish policies fell on fertile soil in Vienna, where latent anti-Semitism had increased during the early 20th century. Immediately after the Anschluss the Jews of Vienna were subject to violence from the State as well as from Antisemites acting out of their own sadism. During the Reichskristallnacht on November 9, 1938, the synagogues, the Jewish centres of not only religious, but also social life, were destroyed. In August, the KZ Oberlanzendorf Wien (Central Office for Jewish Emigration) was created. Its head was Adolf Eichmann. On the whole, and despite some instances of anti-Semitism, the city of Vienna was less supportive of the Nazi regime than was the rest of Austria. This however did not reach any extent of an organised resistance. Hitler himself hated Vienna and was determined to build up Linz, his childhood hometown, and relegate Vienna to backwater status.\nIn the course of the expansion of the city in 1938, 91 adjoining municipalities were incorporated into the city, from which the 22nd (Gro\u00df-Enzersdorf), the 23rd (Schwechat), the 24th (M\u00f6dling), the 25th (Liesing) and the 26th (Klosterneuburg) districts were created. With an area of 1,224 km2, this made Vienna the city with the largest territory in the Third Reich."

            "reference_answer": "The annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938, known as the Anschluss, was the culmination of a series of political and social developments that significantly shaped the landscape of Vienna and the broader Austrian context. Several key factors contributed to the rise of anti-Semitic sentiments in Vienna during this period, as well as the city's unique response compared to the rest of Austria.\n\n### Key Factors Leading to the Annexation:\n\n1. **Post-World War I Instability**: The end of World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary led to significant political and economic instability in Austria. The establishment of the Republic of Deutsch-\u00d6sterreich and later the First Republic faced challenges, including economic difficulties and political polarization, which created a fertile ground for extremist ideologies.\n\n2. **Austrofascism and Authoritarian Rule**: The rise of Engelbert Dollfu\u00df and the establishment of the St\u00e4ndestaat (corporatist state) in the early 1930s marked a shift towards authoritarianism. Dollfu\u00df's regime suppressed leftist parties, including the Social Democrats and the Communist Party, which alienated many citizens and created a vacuum that extremist groups, including the Nazis, sought to exploit.\n\n3. **Economic Crisis**: The global economic crisis of the late 1920s and early 1930s exacerbated social tensions and discontent. The collapse of major banks, such as the Creditanstalt in 1931, led to widespread unemployment and hardship, which fueled resentment and scapegoating, particularly against the Jewish population.\n\n4. **Nazi Propaganda and Ideology**: The Nazi Party's propaganda effectively capitalized on existing anti-Semitic sentiments, portraying Jews as responsible for economic woes and societal problems. This rhetoric resonated with segments of the population, particularly in urban centers like Vienna, where anti-Semitism had historical roots.\n\n5. **Political Mobilization**: The Nazi Party's activities in Austria intensified in the 1930s, with increased organization and mobilization efforts. The party's ability to present itself as a solution to the economic and political crises contributed to its growing popularity.\n\n### Rise of Anti-Semitic Sentiments in Vienna:\n\n- **Historical Context**: Anti-Semitism had been a persistent issue in Vienna, with a history of discrimination and violence against Jews. The socio-economic turmoil of the interwar period exacerbated these sentiments, leading to increased hostility towards the Jewish community.\n\n- **State-Sponsored Violence**: Following the Anschluss, the Nazi regime implemented anti-Jewish policies that included violence and intimidation. The Reichskristallnacht in November 1938 marked a significant escalation, with synagogues and Jewish centers being destroyed, reflecting the culmination of anti-Semitic sentiments that had been building over the years.\n\n### Vienna's Response Compared to the Rest of Austria:\n\n- **Mixed Reception of the Nazi Regime**: While Vienna had a significant population that supported the Nazi regime, it was also home to many who were less enthusiastic about the Anschluss compared to rural areas of Austria, where support for Hitler was more pronounced. The city's intellectual and cultural elite often harbored more liberal and leftist views, which contrasted with the more conservative rural sentiments.\n\n- **Lack of Organized Resistance**: Despite some instances of anti-Nazi sentiment, Vienna did not develop a significant organized resistance against the regime. The political suppression under Dollfu\u00df had already weakened leftist movements, leaving little room for effective opposition.\n\nIn summary, the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany was influenced by a combination of political instability, economic hardship, and the rise of extremist ideologies, with anti-Semitic sentiments in Vienna being fueled by historical prejudices and exacerbated by the socio-economic context. Vienna's response to the Nazi regime was characterized by a complex mix of support and ambivalence, differing from the more uniform support seen in other parts of Austria.",

As in other major cities of Nazi Germany, large flak towers were constructed in Vienna as defensive structures against these bombers. These structures remain in place today, as they are so thick and their foundations so deep that to destroy them would damage surrounding buildings.\nThe U.S. bombings of 1944 and 1945 and the vicious fighting during the subsequent conquest of Vienna by Soviet troops in April 1945 caused much destruction within the city.

On April 29, 1945, the parliament building passed from the occupation force to the new Austrian government, and Karl Renner announced the reinstitution of the democratic Republic of Austria. Vienna was divided into five occupation zones between the Soviet Union, the United States, the UK, France, and with the first district (city centre) being patrolled by all four.\nThe first municipal elections were held in November 1945. Of the 100 seats in the municipal council, the left-wing Social Democratic Party captured 58, the right-wing Austrian People's Party 36, and the Communists 6. In 1946, it was decided that the expansion of city territory of 1938 should be reversed, but this law was delayed by a veto of the occupying powers and was not put into practice until 1954.

This peace treaty was called a state treaty because Austria had temporarily ceased to exist in 1938.\nAfter the war, as everywhere in Western Europe, there was an enormous economic boom, among other things because of the economic aid resulting from the Marshall Plan.\nPublic transport in Vienna was improved by the introduction of the new U-Bahn network, the first part of which was opened in 1978. In 1979, the second Strategic Arms Limitation Talks treaty was signed in Vienna. During the 1970s, Vienna became the third official seat of the United Nations, and the UNO-City was built. At the end of the 20th century, a skyline consisting of several skyscrapers was created with, among others, the Andromeda Tower and Millennium Tower on the left and right sides of the Danube. Furthermore, a complex of skyscrapers was planned at the site of the Wien Mitte railway station, which might have endangered the position of Vienna's centre as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The project has since been redesigned.\nVienna was the capital of the surrounding Bundesland of Lower Austria (German: Nieder\u00f6sterreich) until 1986, when it was replaced by Sankt P\u00f6lten. As Vienna was not a geographical part of Lower Austria it was a capital outside of the territory it served.\nIn the municipal elections of 2001, the Social Democrats regained an absolute majority. With the Liberal Forum not gaining enough votes, only four parties have been represented in the municipal council since then. In the 2005 elections, the Social Democrats further increased their majority.\n\nEspionage in Austria is legal if the country itself is not the target.

Despite the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, as of July 2023 there are more than 180 accredited Russian diplomats in Vienna, and reportedly more than one third are spies using diplomatic cover; Chinese, Iranian, Israeli, Saudi, American, British, and other European spies and counterspies are also in the country.

            "reference_answer": "World War II had a significant impact on Vienna, both in terms of its physical infrastructure and its social fabric. One of the notable defensive measures taken during the war was the construction of flak towers. These massive structures were built to protect the city from Allied bombers, which began targeting Vienna in 1943 as the war progressed. The flak towers were designed to be robust, with thick walls and deep foundations, making them difficult to destroy. As a result, they remain standing today, serving as a reminder of the city's wartime history.\n\nThe Allied bombings, particularly those carried out by the U.S. in 1944 and 1945, caused extensive destruction throughout Vienna. The city experienced significant damage during the bombings, which targeted military and industrial sites but also affected residential and historic areas. The fighting that ensued during the Soviet conquest of Vienna in April 1945 further exacerbated the destruction. Despite the widespread devastation, some historic buildings managed to survive the bombardment, while many others were reconstructed in the post-war period.\n\nThe combination of flak tower construction and the impact of bombings illustrates the dual nature of Vienna's experience during World War II: on one hand, the city fortified itself against aerial attacks, while on the other, it faced the harsh realities of warfare that led to the loss of many of its architectural treasures. The post-war reconstruction efforts aimed to restore the city's historic character, reflecting a resilience and commitment to preserving Vienna's cultural heritage in the aftermath of the conflict.",

            "reference_answer": "The Austrian State Treaty of 1955 was a pivotal agreement that marked Austria's restoration of political independence and sovereignty after World War II. Its significance lies in several key aspects:\n\n1. **Restoration of Sovereignty**: The treaty formally ended the occupation of Austria by the Allied powers, which had been divided into zones controlled by the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. This restoration allowed Austria to regain its status as a sovereign nation, which had been compromised since the annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938.\n\n2. **Establishment of Neutrality**: One of the most important implications of the treaty was the establishment of Austria's permanent neutrality. The Austrian Parliament amended the treaty to enshrine this principle, which meant that Austria would not join military alliances or participate in military conflicts. This neutrality was similar to that of Switzerland and became a cornerstone of Austrian foreign policy, allowing the country to act as a mediator in international affairs and host various diplomatic negotiations.\n\n3. **Context of Post-War Europe**: The treaty was significant in the broader context of post-war Europe, as it represented a shift towards stability and peace in a continent still recovering from the devastation of the war. Austria's neutrality allowed it to navigate the tensions of the Cold War, providing a neutral ground for diplomacy and international organizations, including the United Nations.\n\n4. **Economic Recovery**: Following the treaty, Austria experienced an economic boom, aided by the Marshall Plan. The restoration of sovereignty and the establishment of a stable political environment contributed to economic growth and the development of infrastructure, including improvements in public transport.\n\n5. **Cultural and Diplomatic Hub**: With its neutrality and strategic location, Austria, particularly Vienna, became a center for international diplomacy and espionage. The presence of numerous diplomats and international organizations in Vienna underscored the city's role as a significant player in global affairs.\n\nIn summary, the Austrian State Treaty of 1955 was crucial for re-establishing Austria as an independent nation, defining its neutral stance in international relations, and contributing to the political and economic stability of post-war Europe.",

            "reference_answer": "Karl Lueger's mayoralty in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Vienna, as presented in Richard S. Geehr's work, is significant for several reasons, particularly in how it shaped the political and cultural landscape of the city during a transformative period. Lueger, who served as mayor from 1897 to 1910, is often noted for his populist approach and his ability to connect with the working-class electorate, which allowed him to rise to power in a city marked by social and political upheaval.\n\nOne of the key aspects of Lueger's leadership was his promotion of Christian Socialism, which sought to address the needs of the lower and middle classes while simultaneously fostering a sense of national identity. This movement was characterized by a blend of social welfare policies and a strong anti-Semitic rhetoric, which resonated with many Viennese citizens at the time. Lueger's administration implemented various public works projects and social programs that improved living conditions for many, but his use of anti-Semitism as a political tool also deepened societal divisions and laid the groundwork for future discrimination.\n\nCulturally, Lueger's mayoralty coincided with a flourishing of the arts and intellectual life in Vienna. His administration supported various cultural initiatives, including the establishment of public institutions and the promotion of local artists. This period saw the rise of influential figures in music, literature, and the visual arts, contributing to Vienna's reputation as a cultural capital. However, Lueger's legacy is complex; while he fostered cultural development, his policies also reflected and exacerbated the tensions surrounding ethnic and religious identities in the city.\n\nGeehr's work highlights how Lueger's leadership not only influenced the immediate political landscape but also had lasting implications for Vienna's social fabric. His tenure marked a shift towards a more populist and nationalist political climate, which would have repercussions in the years leading up to World War I and beyond. The interplay of Lueger's policies with the cultural movements of the time illustrates the intricate relationship between politics and culture in shaping the identity of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Vienna.",

            "reference_answer": "Micaela Baranello's \"The Operetta Empire\" explores the significant role of music theater, particularly operetta, in early twentieth-century Vienna, highlighting its reflection of the social and cultural dynamics of the time. Several key themes emerge from her analysis:\n\n1. **Cultural Identity and Nationalism**: Operetta served as a medium through which various cultural identities were expressed and negotiated. In a multi-ethnic empire like Austria-Hungary, operettas often incorporated elements from different national traditions, reflecting the complexities of identity and the rise of nationalism. This blending of styles allowed for a dialogue between different cultural groups, showcasing both unity and tension within the empire.\n\n2. **Social Commentary and Satire**: The operetta genre was known for its humorous and satirical take on contemporary society. Baranello discusses how operettas often critiqued social norms, class structures, and political issues, providing audiences with a lens through which to view and question their own realities. This aspect of operetta made it a popular form of entertainment that resonated with the public, as it addressed their concerns and aspirations.\n\n3. **Gender Roles and Representation**: The portrayal of gender in operetta is another significant theme. Baranello examines how female characters were often depicted in ways that both reinforced and challenged traditional gender roles. The operetta stage became a space for exploring women's desires, autonomy, and societal expectations, reflecting the changing dynamics of gender in early twentieth-century Vienna.\n\n4. **Urban Modernity and Escapism**: The rise of urban life and modernity in Vienna during this period is mirrored in the themes and settings of operettas. Baranello highlights how operettas often provided an escape from the pressures of modern life, offering audiences a fantastical view of romance, adventure, and leisure. This escapism was particularly appealing in a time of social upheaval and uncertainty, allowing people to momentarily transcend their everyday struggles.\n\n5. **Artistic Innovation and Collaboration**: The operetta genre was characterized by collaboration among composers, librettists, and performers, leading to innovative artistic expressions. Baranello discusses how this collaborative spirit fostered a vibrant cultural scene in Vienna, where music theater became a site for experimentation and the blending of different artistic influences.\n\nIn summary, Baranello's \"The Operetta Empire\" illustrates how operetta in early twentieth-century Vienna was not merely entertainment but a complex reflection of the era's social, cultural, and political dynamics. Through its themes of identity, social critique, gender representation, urban modernity, and artistic collaboration, operetta captured the essence of a society in transition, making it a vital part of Vienna's cultural history.",

            "reference_answer": "In her article \"Museums as Engines of Identity,\" Heidemarie Uhl explores the significant role that museums played in shaping cultural identity in Vienna around 1900. During this period, Vienna was a vibrant hub of artistic and intellectual activity, and museums served as crucial institutions for the construction and dissemination of cultural narratives.\n\nUhl argues that museums were not merely repositories of art and artifacts; they were active participants in the cultural discourse of the time. They contributed to the formation of a collective identity by curating exhibitions that reflected the diverse and often conflicting narratives of Vienna's multicultural society. This was particularly important in a city characterized by its complex social fabric, which included various ethnic groups, including Jews, and a range of artistic movements.\n\nThe exhibitions organized by museums often highlighted the achievements of Austrian artists and intellectuals, thereby fostering a sense of national pride and cultural belonging. They also provided a platform for the exploration of modernity, as artists and curators engaged with contemporary themes and ideas. This engagement with modernity was crucial in a city that was grappling with the tensions between tradition and innovation.\n\nMoreover, Uhl emphasizes that museums played a role in the public sphere, influencing how citizens perceived their own identities and the identities of others. By showcasing certain narratives while marginalizing others, museums contributed to the construction of a dominant cultural memory that shaped public consciousness. This process of selection and representation was vital in defining what it meant to be Viennese during this transformative period.\n\nIn summary, Uhl's analysis highlights that museums in Vienna around 1900 were instrumental in shaping cultural identity by curating narratives that reflected the city's diverse heritage, fostering a sense of belonging, and engaging with the complexities of modernity. These institutions not only preserved the past but also actively participated in the ongoing dialogue about identity, memory, and culture in a rapidly changing society.",

            "reference_answer": "In \"Karl Lueger and the Ambiguities of Viennese Antisemitism,\" Robert Wistrich explores the multifaceted nature of antisemitism in Vienna during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly under the leadership of Karl Lueger, the mayor of Vienna from 1897 to 1910. Wistrich highlights several factors that contributed to the ambiguous character of antisemitism during this period, which had significant implications for the Jewish community in Vienna.\n\n1. **Political Context**: Lueger's rise to power was marked by a populist approach that utilized antisemitic rhetoric to galvanize support among the Christian populace. His political strategy involved portraying Jews as scapegoats for various social and economic issues, which resonated with many Viennese citizens. However, Lueger's administration also relied on Jewish contributions to the city's cultural and economic life, creating a paradox where antisemitism was both a tool for political mobilization and a complex reality that could not entirely dismiss the Jewish community's role in Vienna.\n\n2. **Cultural Ambivalence**: The cultural landscape of Vienna at the time was characterized by a rich tapestry of artistic and intellectual contributions from Jewish individuals. This cultural prominence created a tension between admiration for Jewish achievements and the underlying currents of antisemitism. Wistrich notes that while antisemitic sentiments were prevalent, there was also a recognition of the Jews' integral role in the cultural and intellectual life of the city, leading to a contradictory relationship that complicated the nature of antisemitism.\n\n3. **Social Dynamics**: The social fabric of Vienna was marked by class divisions and economic competition, which exacerbated antisemitic sentiments. Many non-Jewish Viennese viewed Jews as competitors in business and professional fields, leading to resentment. However, this competition was often intertwined with a recognition of the Jews' contributions to the city's economy, further complicating the narrative of antisemitism.\n\n4. **Religious Factors**: The historical context of Catholicism in Austria played a significant role in shaping antisemitic attitudes. Lueger, as a Catholic politician, leveraged religious sentiments to foster a sense of Christian identity that was often defined in opposition to Judaism. This religious dimension added another layer of complexity to the antisemitic discourse, as it was not solely based on racial or ethnic grounds but also intertwined with religious beliefs and practices.\n\n5. **Impact on the Jewish Community**: The ambiguous nature of antisemitism during Lueger's tenure had profound effects on the Jewish community in Vienna. On one hand, the Jewish population experienced increased social and economic opportunities, as their contributions were acknowledged and valued. On the other hand, the pervasive antisemitic rhetoric fostered an environment of insecurity and fear, leading to a sense of vulnerability among Jews. The duality of being both integral to the city's success and simultaneously targeted by antisemitic sentiments created a precarious existence for the Jewish community.\n\nIn summary, Wistrich's analysis reveals that the complexities of Viennese antisemitism during Karl Lueger's time were shaped by a confluence of political, cultural, social, and religious factors. This ambiguity not only influenced the dynamics of antisemitism but also had lasting implications for the Jewish community, highlighting the intricate interplay between acceptance and exclusion in the context of Viennese society.",
