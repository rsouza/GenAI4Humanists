    "Databricks' dolly-v2-12b, an instruction-following large language model trained on the Databricks machine learning platform that is licensed for commercial use. Based on pythia-12b, Dolly is trained on ~15k instruction/response fine tuning records databricks-dolly-15k generated by Databricks employees in capability domains from the InstructGPT paper, including brainstorming, classification, closed QA, generation, information extraction, open QA and summarization. dolly-v2-12b is not a state-of-the-art model, but does exhibit surprisingly high quality instruction following behavior not characteristic of the foundation model on which it is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dolly v2 is also available in these smaller models sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    dolly-v2-7b, a 6.9 billion parameter based on pythia-6.9b\n",
