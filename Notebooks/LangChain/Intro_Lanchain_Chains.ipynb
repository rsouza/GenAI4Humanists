    "\n",
    "The LangChain pipelines consist of the following modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Models**: Models mostly cover Large Language models. A large language model of considerable size is a model that comprises a neural network with numerous parameters and is trained on vast quantities of unlabeled text  \n",
    "+ **Prompts**: prompt is the input that we give to any system to refine our answers to make them more accurate or more specific according to our use case. Many times you may want to get more structured information than just text back. We can use Prompts in conjunction with Parsers\n",
    "+ **Parsers**: Output parsers are responsible for taking the output of an LLM and transforming it to a more suitable format. This is very useful when you are using LLMs to generate any form of structured data.  \n",
    "+ **Memory**: Chains and Agents in LangChain operate in a stateless mode by default, meaning that they handle each incoming query independently. However, there are certain applications, like chatbots, where it is of great importance to retain previous interactions, both over the short and long term. This is where the concept of “Memory” comes into play.  \n",
    "+ **Chains**: Chains provide a means to merge various components into a unified application. A chain can be created, for instance, that receives input from a user, formats it using a PromptTemplate, and subsequently transmits the formatted reply to an LLM. More intricate chains can be generated by integrating multiple chains with other components.  \n",
    "+ **Agents**: Certain applications may necessitate not only a pre-determined sequence of LLM/other tool calls but also an uncertain sequence that is dependent on the user’s input. These kinds of sequences include an “agent” that has access to a range of tools. Based on the user input, the agent may determine which of these tools, if any, should be called.  \n",
    "+ **Callbacks**: Allow you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. This is useful for logging, monitoring, streaming, and other tasks.  \n",
    "+ **Indexes**: Indexes are information stored in local databases that can be used for Augment the capabilities of the models being used. We will see them in action with RAG pipelines  \n",

Sunlight and Molecules:** \\nSunlight, which appears white to our eyes, is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow.  When this sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with tiny gas molecules (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) present in the air.\\n\\n**2. Scattering:** \\nThese molecules scatter light in all directions when it hits them. However, blue light scatters more effectively than other colours due to a specific property of its wavelength.  Blue light has shorter wavelengths than red or orange light.\\n\\n**3. Blue Sky:** \\nThe scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions across the sky, making us see a predominantly blue color. This is why we often see a clear, bright blue sky during the day.\\n\\n **Additional Points:**\\n\\n* **Time of Day:** At sunrise and sunset, the sunlight travels through a thicker layer of atmosphere.  This causes more scattering of shorter wavelengths like blue light, resulting in warm colors like orange and red.\\n* **Cloud Color:** Clouds appear white or gray because they are made up of larger water droplets that scatter all colors of light equally. \\n\\n\\nLet me know if you have any other questions! 🌎 🌞 🌈 \\n\""
