    "# Semantic_Image_Search\n",
    "[source](https://github.com/emily-gibbs/articles/blob/main/image_semantic_search_with_vectors/code_walkthrough.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever taken forever trying to find a specific photo in a photo folder? Or tried to search an image repository for just the right image for a presentation and can't seem to find what you're looking for? It may be that the technology underlying your image search is based on outdated methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward and traditional way to perform an image search is with tags - each image is assigned relevant tags, and when someone searches the tag those images are returned. However, there are several problems with this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Can't handle synonyms - what if the tag is 'funny', but the user searches with 'silly'? It would be very hard to tag an image with ALL of the ways a user could phrase their search. \n",
    "No sense of degree - with thousands of images, a user would likely prefer to see images ranked by how closely they match the query (e.g. from most silly to least silly)\n",
    "Time consuming - It takes time and effort to make sure all images are correctly tagged and that relevant tags are assigned when new images are added. \n",
    "What a user really wants is to be able to search based upon meaning, not a finite set of words. This is where vectors embeddings come to the rescue! 🥳\n",
    "\n",
    "a vector embedding is a list of numbers that represents features of something. They represent the semantic meaning of unstructured data such as chunks of text, images, videos, etc. We can measure how similar two vectors are (are therefore how similar their source objects are) with the cosine similarity formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we leveraged this idea for an image search? Remember - once an object is embedded into the meaning space it doesn't matter what form it took before (text, image, audio, etc.). The only thing that matters is it's meaning. So if we create vectors for all of our images, then create a vector for our search text, we should be able to use cosine similarity to compare them and find what images best match our search!\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound kind of confusing? Let's walk through the code implementation step-by-step so we can see what a proof of concept of this would look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must ensure that the image embeddings and the text embeddings are in the same meaning space. This is important! Models that create vector embeddings from inputs each create their own unique meaning space. This is because the features of the vector are unique to the model (and the number of features may be different too!). We can't just embed an image with a random image model then embed our search text with a different random text model and compare the two to each other -even if they did have the same number of features, its like comparing apples to orangutans and you'll get back nonsense results!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately there are models that have been trained on multiple input modalities and embed them into the same meaning space. The one we'll be using today is called [OpenCLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/open_clip), an open-source implementation of the CLIP model created by OpenAI. \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCLIP actually has several model versions that you can load and use. We'll be using the \"ViT-g-14\" model for this tutorial, but I encourage you to explore the other models that are available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by installing some libraries:"
